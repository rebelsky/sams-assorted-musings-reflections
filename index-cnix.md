================================================================================

## Introduction

[Introduction, part 1: On the genesis of this work](cnix-intro-1) (Essay #175)

> The genesis of this set of writing.

[Introduction, part 2: Thinking in C](cnix-thinking-in-c) (Essay #176)

> What I mean by "thinking in C".

[Introduction, part 3: Thinking in Unix](cnix-thinking-in-unix) (Essay #178) 

> What I mean by "thinking in Unix"

[Introduction, part 4: Thinking like SamR (or Some of SamR's perspectives on software development)](cnix-thinking-like-sam) (Essay #216)

> Additional perspectives that underlie the rest of the course/book/essays.

## Bash Basics

[Bash basics: files and directories](cnix-bash-basics-files) (Essay #196)

> A short introduction to what you should know about the shell, including
  a bit of information on files and directories.  I hope that this is
  mostly review.

[File permissions](cnix-file-permissions) (Essay #246)

> Who can read what you write, or write what you read?

## Miscellaneous Unix Topics

[`grep` and regular expressions](cnix-grep-regexp) (Essay #199)

> Ways of representing patterns in text and a tool for using it.

Combining programs

> Unix systems provide power by allowing you to combine programs
  in interesting ways.  Here are some of them.

Searching files with `grep`

> One way to find things

Searching files with `find`

> Another way to find things.

[Command-line history](cnix-command-line-history) (Essay #232)

> Remembering what you did (or letting the computer remember for you).

## Adventures of binary search

[Adventures in binary search, part the first](cnix-binary-search-1) (Essay #219)

> In which we set the stage.

[Adventures in binary search, part the second: Designing tests](cnix-binary-search-2) (Essay #220)

> In which we explore how to test our procedure.

[Adventures in binary search, part the third: Implementing binary search](cnix-binary-search-3) (Essay #221)

> In which we consider strategies.

## Miscellaneous C Topics

[Preconditions for strcpy](cnix-preconditions-strcpy) (Musing #1130)

> Attempts to understand memory usage.

[Stages of C compilation](cnix-compilation-phases) (Essay #179) 

> What some of those stages are, and why you should know.

[The C Preprocessor](cnix-c-preprocessor) (Musing #268)

> More information on an early stage.

[An introduction to C macros](cnix-intro-macros) (Musing #280)

> More preprocessing!

[Simple macros for testing C programs](cnix-simple-testing-macros) (Musing #283)

> An application of macros, along with some further exploration of some macro design issues.

[Using macros for generic structures in C](cnix-macros-generics) (Musing #287)

> Another application of macros: Writing generic structures that can hold a variety of values.

Additional compiler flags

> C compiler flags you should know.

[Using `assert` in C](cnix-assert) (Essay #180)

> An awesomely useful macro.

[Why function signatures matter](cnix-signatures-matter) (Essay #190)

> If you don't tell the compiler what you're doing, it may give
  you different results than you expect.

[Formatting C Code](cnix-formatting-c) (Essay #197)

> Why style counts and how to achieve it.

[Output buffers](cnix-output-buffers) (Essay #210)

> Why `printf` doesn't always do what you expect.

Modifiers

> `static`, `extern`, and many more things you never knew you could
  (or should) use.

[Parsing integers](cnix-parsing-integers) (Essay #185)

> How to parse integers sensibly, as well as a variety of other reflections
on program design.

[Building C libraries](cnix-libraries) (Essay #194)

> Programmers know how to build their own libraries.

[Designing a C library: Arbitrarily large integers](cnix-alint-library) (Essay #249)

> An example

Using C Libraries

> Good programmers also know how to use libraries (and what libraries might
  be useful).

Make
----

[A simple C project](cnix-simple-c-project) (Essay #181)

> Thinking broadly.

[An introduction to Make](cnix-make-intro) (Essay #183)

> Basics of a build automation tool that we'll use throughout the
course.

[Variables in Make](cnix-make-variables) (Essay #187)

> Why and how to use variables in Make.

[Implicit rules in Make](cnix-make-implicit-rules) (Essay #188)

> Making your Makefiles more general and more concise.

[Standard Make targets](cnix-make-standard-targets) (Essay #245)

> Things you should expect to see in a typical Makefile (and to put
  in your own Makefiles).
