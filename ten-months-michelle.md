It's strange. One day I was saying to myself, "I feel like I'm doing better." The next, I was bawling at the slightest provocation, such as donating to support [MINK-WIC](https://minkwic.org) in Michelle's memory or just talking to a friend about her.

One night, I dreamed that I was talking to someone about Michelle. We were discussing why things were still set out as she'd left them. My answer was, approximately, "She's been sick, but we hope she'll be back soon, so we're leaving things as they are." I knew she'd been gone for nine months. But my mind (or my dreaming mind) was convinced that she'd still be back.

I also miss aspects of Michelle that others didn't see. I particularly miss the silly Michelle. But I even miss the angry Michelle. I'm not up to sharing details about either Michelle, but they are so special to me.
