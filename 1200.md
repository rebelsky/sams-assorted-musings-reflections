This musing is my twelve hundredth musing.  More accurately, it's
the musing numbered 1200.  I've written more than 1200; I just
haven't posted them all.  And, um, I've unposted a few, too.  But
we'll go with 1200.  If I have a numbering system, I might as well
stick with it.

Multiples of 100 seem to be a good time to step back and reflect
on the endeavor.  It appears that I posted [my first
musing](contacting-faculty) on April 19, 2016.  At least that's
when I put it in the GitHub repository.  Since I put my second
musing in the repository on the 20th, the 19th seems accurate.  If
I recall correctly, at the time, I realized that (a) I had things
that I kept telling people and (b) I had things I wanted to complain
about in public [1].

I'm too lazy to re-read the early musings right now, but I believe
my plan was to try to write daily, or approximately daily, until I
ran out of things to write about.  I haven't run out of things to
write about, but I've repeatedly run out of time, energy, or
motivation to write daily.

Let's see ... I posted musing 1100 more than two years ago, on July
19, 2020 [2].  That's not even a musing per week.  Damn.  In any
case, I had hoped to restart daily musings at the start of the
summer.  I failed.  Perhaps I'll manage this fall.  It seems like
a good leave project [3].

I wonder how I did on the previous 100's.  Musing 1000 was posted
on January 27, 2020.  So musings 1000-1100 were written over six
months, rather than two years.  That seems to be approximately one
every two day.  Semi-daily?  Bi-daily?  Tri-weekly?  What's a good
term.

Musing 900 was posted on September 14, 2019.  Musings 900-1000 were
posted almost daily.  Musing 800 was posted on November 5, 2018.
It appears, musings 800-900 took about ten months.

Okay, I'm bored of this analysis.  I assume that you are, too.  My
conclusion?  There are times I've mused daily; there are times I
haven't mused daily.  I should probably write "There are times mused
_or ranted_ daily; there are times I've haven't mused _or ranted_
daily."  I'm not sure that it matters.

What does matter?  My health.  My family.  Justice in the world.

Whoops.  I answered the question out of context.  In terms of Sam's
Assorted Musings and Rants, what matters most is that I benefit
from writing and what matters second most is that others benefit
from the writing.  I always benefit from writing, but I don't always
have time to write [4].  And, as much as I hate to admit it, I don't
always benefit from ranting.  Why not?  Ranting tends to raise my
blood pressure, rather than lower it.  Alternately, ranting does
not necessarily improve my mood.  But it can.  So I'll still rant.
And muse.  And, I suppose, blather on and on about pointless things.
Perhaps I'll even work on improving my writing.  Maybe I should take
Ralph's course again.

I worry that my brain is not functioning as well as it has in the
past.  Certainly, this musing doesn't seem to have the Sammish
silliness that I usually need to sneak in.  The data analysis doesn't
have the same depth.  The sentences seem about the same as normal;
not too sophisticated or varied, but still comprehensible.  Or
semi-comprehensible.

What musings do I have planned?  I'm not keeping a notebook right
now, but I have a rant planned that was inspired by Dean Montgomery's
excellent Community Friday, a tribute to my amazing wife on our
35th wedding anniversary, a response to Dean Montgomery's question
about the three sisters, a not-quite-FAQ about my leave, a bad joke
inspired by Dean Montgomery [5,6], a reflection on transfer credits,
and something about our new registration system [7].  That's about
all I have planned right now.  I'm sure that other things will come
up.  After all, three days ago three of those topics weren't even on
my mind.

See you in the funny pages.  Or on the Interweb.  Or something like that.

[1] I'm not sure the latter is a good thing.  But there are times that it's nice to
know that other people share your frustrations, and I think it's good that students
can sometimes see that faculty share their frustrations.  At the time, I was
complaining about the discontinuation of Posse.  I still miss Posse.  I'm glad we've
upped the number of Questbridge scholars we support.

[2] Today is August 27, 2022.

[3] More on the leave forthcoming.

[4] I've also found times in which the words fail to flow.  It's not
worth forcing them at such times.

[5] Dean Montgomery seems to inspire me.

[6] I have to do the occasional short musing.

[7] Rant?  Reflection?  Musing?  Joke?  I'm not sure.  I'll figure it out when
I write it.
