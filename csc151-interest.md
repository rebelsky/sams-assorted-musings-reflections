Dear Student [1],

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in taking CSC-151, _Functional
Problem Solving_.  CSC-151 is an awesome course and Computer Science
is a wonderful discipline, good not only helping you to think
differently but also for contributing some skills that may be
applicable in a wide variety of other disciplines.

The CS department does our best to ensure that every Grinnell student
who wants to take CSC-151 can do so and that every Grinnell student
who wants to major in CS can also do so.  However, our resources
are limited.  So you won't always be able to start CSC-151 when you
plan to.  And you may find it harder to add it as a fallback course.

Here's what I can tell you based on recent experience.

_Not all incoming first-year students who want to take CSC-151 in
their first semester will be able to do so._  Grinnell's registration
system does not provide us easy access to information about how
many incoming first-years try to register and cannot.  I have heard
that we generally close in the first round of registration.  But
don't worry!  It's fine to start exploring CS in your second semester!
About half of our majors don't start until then.

_All students who are interested in taking CSC-151 in their first
year should be able to do so._  We have yet to close a first-year
student out of the spring sections of CSC-151 [2].  I hope we never
have to.  I suppose it's a possibility, but it's unlikely.

_All students interested in taking CSC-151 in the fall of their
second year who preregister for CSC-151 that semester should be
able to do so._  Once again, we have yet to close out a rising
second-year student who preregisters for the course.

_You can complete a CS major even if you take CSC-151 in the fall
of your second year._  While we would generally recommend that
students start exploring the potential for a CS major in their first
year, the major is designed so that you can start in the fall of
your second year.  Depending on a host of other factors (e.g., your
math background, whether you plan to study abroad), you might even
be able to start a CS major by taking CSC-151 in the Spring of your
second year.  However, we would strongly discourage that approach.

_If you do not preregister for CSC-151, your chances of getting the
course are significantly reduced._  For the Fall sections of CSC-151,
we need to reserve spaces for incoming first-years, so we do not
allow anyone to add the course after preregistration.  For the
Spring sections of CSC-151, we generally find that the course fills,
and sometimes over-fills, during preregistration.  Once again, there
isn't room to add more students.

Is there a moral to all of this?  I suppose "Preregister" is one
conclusion you should reach.  I'd add "If you want to take CS at
Grinnell, you are best off trying to take it in your first two
years." We're not alone in having that approximate policy.  Gender,
Women's, and Sexuality Studies limits registration from upper-level
students, as does Linguistics.  And we do manage to fit many
third-years and seniors into CSC-151.  It's just easier for students
if they start early.  A happier conclusion is that we've been able
to serve all students who try to take CS in their first two years.

Regards,

SamR

**_Alternate Version_**

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in CS.

As per department policy, we kept all rising second-years who preregistered for the course and have reserved all of the remaining seats for incoming first-year students.  

I'm happy to put you on the waiting list for the course, but I won't be able to let you know anything for certain until after the incoming first-years preregister in the fall.

Sorry that I can't be of more help.

**_Postscript_**: This musing was inspired by the host of emails
from students asking to be added to CSC-151 in Fall 2021.  As the
longer note suggests, we cut anyone who wasn't a rising second-year
and we're holding all remaining slots for incoming first-years.
The rising second-years who did not preregister are on a waiting
list.

[1] If you address me as "Prof." or "Professor", I will address you
with a similarly generic title.

[2] I suppose I should also note that we used to say the same thing
about Calculus, but have had years that we've had to close first-years
out of Fall Calculus.
