It's the time of year that I'm submitting recommendations for
students to go to graduate school.  As I think I've noted before,
graduate recommendations take time.  I find it hard to write a good
recommendation letter in under an hour, and I'm usually a fairly
quick writer.  And the letter has to be customized for each
institution if only to change the institution name.  

In some cases, I add additional notes, such as comparisons to other
students who've attended the institution, or clarification of some
of my ratings.  For example, I find it hard to rank most CS majors
in the top 20% of Grinnellians I've taught, since I teach a lot of
non-CS majors, and those folks in, say, English, can be amazing
writers.  But my experience is that most Grinnellians end up in the
top 20% or higher of graduate students in CS in terms of writing
ability.  So that needs explanation.

As that prior paragraph suggests, I generally need to fill out a
form for each institution.  Most ask for an overall rating.  Most
ask for how long I've known the student and in what capacity.  Many
ask for comparative ratings.  Some ask very specific questions and
insist we address them in the letter [1].  That's something else to
add.

We are also often asked to fill out information about ourselves.
Address, title, etc.

That brings me to the point of this musing [3].  I was recently filling
out a recommendation for a student who is applying to the University
of Chicago, my alma mater [4].  I generally try to switch the prefix
from "Dr." to "Prof.".  Unfortunately, I didn't have that option.
However, I was pleased to see that the UofC does permit "Mx.".  I'm
glad to see my alma mater embrace gender inclusion.

Unfortunately, we do a bit less well later in the form.  There's
a bit that says something like "we want to know if you are an
alumnus/alumna".  I realize that those are Latin terms and therefore
gendered.  However, I believe custom suggests that we can include
a gender-neutral alternative.  Would it hurt to add "alum" or
something similar?  

At least there's some forward progress.

**_Postscript_**: Although the particulars vary, I usually spend between
five and fifteen minutes per institution.  For applicants who apply
to dozen or so institutions (not atypical), a recommendation ends up
taking a bit more than three hours of my life.

It's worth it to support our students, but this is a hard part of the
semester to give up that time.

---

**_Postscript_**: In making comparisons for UofC, I was tempted to
write something like "[The student] is certainly more driven and more
responsible than I was at their age, and I think I've done the program
proud."  But that seems excessive.

---

**_Postscript_**: I don't care that it seems like most of this
musing is about graduate recommendation letters.  The point is
that schools are making some progress on gender-inclusive language.

**_Postscript_**: I recently attempted to write a recommendation
letter without using any pronouns.  It feels very unnatural to
skip pronouns.  "River's experiences and skills will permit River
to support others in the program.  I recommend River highly."  
I want to write "will permit _him_" or "will permit _her_" or
"will permit _them_".  But I'm not sure what pronouns River [6]
uses, and I don't think people should be forced to choose pronouns.

---

**_Postscript_**: Here's my favorite rating scale so far.

> 5\. Outstanding

> 4\. Excellent

> 3\. Good

> 2\. Average

> 1\. Below Average

Isn't it nice to know that the average student is less than good?
We're definitely not in Minnesota.

[1] E.g., "In your letter, please provide evidence for your ranking of
the student's resilience." [2]

[2] I just realized that the request for details on resilience is
why mom included a similar question on [her form for
students](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/recommendation.html).
I wish I had remembered that before I wrote the most recent
recommendation letters.

[3] Four paragraphs or so in, and I'm just getting to the point?
Yeah, that seems to be my normal style.

[4] At least I consider it my alma mater.  Since I've attended, it's
doubled its undergraduate enrollment, moved books to a robotic
underground library, changed its founding date (from 1892 to 1890)
and its abbreviation (from UofC to UChicago), and more.  Plus, CS
has moved from the mercury-filled confines of Ryerson to what I
think of Crerar Library.

[5] It is Chicago; it might lead to nasty letters from some alums
who embrace the Latinate more than inclusion.

[6] In case you couldn't tell, River is a pseudonym.
