A few weeks ago, I wrote about the possibility of [moving
offices](moving-offices-2021-05-18).  About two weeks ago, I learned
that my suggestion of moving to Henry Walker's office was approved,
and I should have my stuff packed by July 10.  I started making
plans.  I thought about what would move where.  I asked about
furniture and was told that I'd hear back from FM.

Then I got an interesting message on my birthday [1].  It contained
a list of office moves, with mine scheduled for June 29th.  That's
a bit sooner than July 10.  Packing will be hard, especially since
I have a trip scheduled in the middle.  But I'm nothing if not
cooperative [2].  So my goal is to get everything boxed in the next
five days.  And as I'm boxing, I'm discarding.  I don't quite have
time to undertake a true Marie Kondo-ish reflection on each [3],
so I'm trying to think broadly.

I don't know how technology gets moved, nor what happens with my
paintings.  I'm packing up my tchotchkes and moving them myself.
So my focus right now is on the books and other printed materials.

I decided to discard all of my copies of _Academe_ and _ACM Inroads_.
I don't like getting rid of either, but I've admitted to myself
that I probably won't look at them again.  All the _Inroads_ articles
should be available online.  And, well, _Academe_ is fun [4], but not
necessary.

I'm about to shred all my old end-of-course evaluations.  I may try
to scan them first.  I know that I would have liked to have read
mom's, and perhaps, my children will eventually want to read mine.
But I'm not likely to read them again.  I had hoped that I still
had the ones from when I first taught CSC-152 [5,6], but those seem
to be gone.

I've offered some of my old books on language [7] to my sons.  I
assume one of them will take the Mencken volumes on the American
Language and the Fowler second edition.  Youngest Son loves Bryan
Garner, but he may already own the Garners that I have.  The language
books were intermixed with the too-many books I have about writing
and teaching writing.  I wasn't going to offer them the latter, but
it sounds like one may want some of them.  After the boys, I'll
give young colleagues a chance to pick through the books. In any
case, I'm unlikely to teach Tutorial again, and, even if I do, I'll
likely stick to tried and true classics [8] plus a few others that
I kept for reference.

I enjoy thinking about intellectual property and have two 42"-long
shelves of books on IP and related issues.  But I'm not going to
teach an IP Tutorial again.  I've offered the two shelves of books
on IP to a colleague in another department who teaches related
issues.  If they don't take them, I'll see if I can find another
taker.

I've offered my books on gender and computing (as well as a scattering
of gender and math, gender and science, and gender and higher ed)
to a young colleague who is thinking a lot about those issues.  It's
an issue that I care a lot about, but I see value in giving resources
to the next generation.  If they don't take them, I'll probably end
up keeping them for a while longer.

I've told the College Archivist that they can take a look at my
five shelves of books related to Grinnell, including not just books
about Grinnell, but books by faculty and alums and about some alums,
such as [Hallie Flanagan](hallie-flanagan).  I assume that the
College owns most of them, but you never know.  I did discover that
I ended up with Bill McKibben's [9] copy of Strunk and White, which
includes his annotations.  I offered that to the archive, too.  I
don't have a great need to get rid of my Grinnell books, but I also
know that my family won't want most of them.  I'm not even sure why
I accumulated so many, other than I find meaning in owning books
related to the College [10].

I tried offering my books on video games to a colleague.  Then I 
discovered that I boxed them up about two years ago and hid them
somewhere in my lab.  But the colleague tells me that they aren't a
book person.  I'll need to find someone else to give them to.  Or
maybe they'll stay in a box for a while.

What other books are left in my old office?  Two shelves of computing
history.  A shelf or two of classic computing texts.  Five shelves
of books on computing and the arts or just the arts.  Five shelves
of subjects related to academia.  I don't have any desire to get rid of
those categories of books right now [11], but I'll still try to
Kondo them.  

Getting rid of individual books is hard.  For example, I picked up
a book of pixel-graphics art that I acquired at some point.  I said
to myself "This doesn't bring me much joy.  I can get rid of it."
But I looked through it first.  And they do some clever things with
die-cut pages.  Those bring my joy.  So, it's in the keep pile.
Bad Sam!

What about my 1127 Park Street Office?  It has two kinds of books: Books
I moved from my old Noyce office, which I'm definitely keeping, and books
I accumulated over the past two years, some of which I'm starting to question.
I just packed a full box [12] of books I purchased on liberal education
to have as references for my Tutorial.  Do I need those?  Do I need the
five shelves of books on academia I already have?  And I forgot to Kondo
them while I was boxing them.  Bad Sam!  I may have to Kondo them when 
I unbox them.  I also know that I have some duplicates.  Who would want
books on liberal education?  I'm not sure.

That's where we stand right now.  Of twenty-five or so shelves worth
of books in my old office, I've offered up about three shelves of
books on language and writing, about two on IP, and a little more
than half a shelf on gender and computing.  I'm not sure how many
shelves I'll end up with in the new office; that's still being
negotiated.  I may have to do more pruning in the office and the
lab just to figure out where to put the current office books [14].
And then I'll need to figure out what goes in my office.

**_Postscript_**: If you read this musing and said to yourself
something like "I'd like Sam's books on liberal education", or IP,
or video games, or whatever, let me know, particularly if you're
in Grinnell.

---

**_Postscript_**: When will I start on the home stuff?  That's a
question for another day.  At times, I just wish I had an assistant
who would be willing to ebay some of the more valuable portions of
it.  Or people I cared about who wanted them.  And I do have to
discuss things with the kids first.

[1] June 17.  Also known as "Bunker Hill Day", sometimes known as 
"Breed's Hill Day".

[2] Stop laughing.

[3] "Does this bring me joy?"  For better or worse, the answer is almost
always "Yes".  I'm trying to say that less frequently.

[4] I realize that my sense of fun may differ from yours.

[5] I had some of my favorite students in that class.  Plus, I graded
almost no homework (only exams), asked students to grade themselves (they 
gave themselves B's), forced students to write reflective essays on 
homework, and got nearly perfect ratings.

[6] CSC-152 was the course in data structures and algorithms in
Java.  I created the Java version when I started teaching at Grinnell.
The prior version had been in Pascal.  After about my first decade at
Grinnell, we renumbered CSC-152 to CSC-207 and added CSC-161 in between.

[7] No, not programming languages.

[8] _Style, Toward Clarity and Grace_ and _The Craft of Research_.  Perhaps
_The Art of Styling Sentences_.

[9] The classicist, not the naturalist.

[10] Finding meaning in books that I don't necessarily read or things I
won't necessarily use is one of the more problematic aspects of my 
personality.  I'm working on it.

[11] I don't have a desire to get rid of any books.  But I have more of
a willingness to get rid of other categories.  I anticipate caring about
art, the history of computing, and higher ed for a while longer.

[12] One foot by one foot by one-and-a-half feet.

[14] I have to do more pruning in the lab in any case.  I was just expecting
that pruning to be a bit less urgent.
