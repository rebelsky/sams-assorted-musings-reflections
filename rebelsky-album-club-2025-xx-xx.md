Friends and long-time readers may know that for the past few years, we had a "Rebelsky Book Club", one only open to the five Rebelskys in our family. We'd choose a book (or books), read it (well, most of us would read it), take notes, order pizza, and then discuss it. It started back when I said that I'd like to hear everyone's opinion on _Mindset_.

Sadly enough, the boys didn't feel emotionally up to continuing the group. However, some time in spring, Middle suggested that we set up a "Music Walks" club. The idea was that each week, one of us would pick a favorite album and we each try to walk and listen to the album each day. I think the primary goals were to help us have a new way to connect and to encourage me to walk more. Unfortunately, it failed at the latter. That is, we have an album each week (or most weeks), but I haven't embraced the idea of walking along to the album. I tried a few days, but didn't keep it up.

What have we listened to? Let's see. In order ...

First up, [Rachmaninov's _All-Night Vigil_ as performaned by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and Paul Hillier](https://music.apple.com/us/album/rachmaninov-vespers-complete-all-night-vigil/679400114).

Continuing the vocal theme, our next album was [_Light and Gold_ performed by Eric Whitacre and the Eric Whitacre Singers](https://music.apple.com/us/album/light-gold/1440758406).

We took a strange detour with [_The Velvet Underground and Nico_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-velvet-underground-nico-45th-anniversary-edition/1440851613). I appreciate one of my offspring's comments about the album.

> It definitely felt a bit "_Seinfeld_ effect" to me: I'm sure a lot of it was really revolutionary at the time but others have since iterated and refined. I also love the garage rock elements.

I hate to admit that he's probably right. But it's been enough of a part of my listening life for the past four-and-a-half decades that I love it.

We then moved onto yet another genre (or set of genres) with [_Level 12_ by Miracle of Sound](https://music.apple.com/us/album/level-12/1752568720).

In honor of Michelle, who loved _Bat Out of Hell_, we tried [Meatloaf's _Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/bat-out-of-hell-ii-back-into-hell/1440790017). If I recall correctly, we decided that the original _Bat Out of Hell_ would be too sad to choose as a piece.

The next choice was [_Muddled_ by TKYOGORE](https://music.apple.com/us/album/muddled/1723785748) that seemed out there enough that we got a backup album, too: [_The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess_ by Chappell Roan](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess/1698723205).

It was at about this point that I realized that I don't listen to lyrics closely enough, or perhaps I just can't hear them well enough.

We returned to the 60's with [_1962--1966_ (aka _The Red Album_) by _The Beatles_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-beatles-1962-1966-the-red-album/1441132965). I still remember buying a copy at that record store down the street from Brigham's in Newton Center.

We continued our foreys into what I'd call non-big-hat mainstream country with [_Whitsitt Chapel_ by Jelly Roll](https://music.apple.com/us/album/whitsitt-chapel/1688698542).

We took an odd detour into modern punk with [_Joy as an Act of Resistance_ by IDLES](https://music.apple.com/us/album/joy-as-an-act-of-resistance/1393364154). I didn't pick this one, but I liked hearing where punk may be going these days.

Next up was another pairing of albums: [_Hit Me Hard and Soft_ by Billie Eilish](https://music.apple.com/us/album/hit-me-hard-and-soft/1739659134) and [_Sounds of Silence_ by Simon & Garfunkel](https://music.apple.com/us/album/sounds-of-silence/192480256). Was the goal to move forward on both the queer affirming and surprisingly old music? I'm not sure. I was reminded how poor the sound of the Simon and Garfunkel albums is. I lack the talent to explain, but they feel like they lack the dynamic range and clarity of sound I'd expect.

Continuing the oldies but still goodies theme, we explored [_Astral Weeks_ by Van Morrison](https://music.apple.com/us/album/astral-weeks/1031002336). I enjoyed revisiting some of the history of the album (e.g., that for something that feels so organic, it had almost no real collaboration between Morrison and the players; some instruments, such as strings and horns, were added later without Morrison's permission).

Up next? [_Masks_ by Aviators](https://music.apple.com/us/album/masks/1485209877) because "It keeps showing up on my playlists".

After that we listened to [_Thaumatrope_ by Marah in the Mainsail](https://music.apple.com/us/album/thaumatrope/1024027843). Again, "a song on the the album keeps showing up in my recommendations". I suppose that I'll have to start making mixes so taht I can choose albums in the same way.
