I've been thinking a lot about Grinnell's registration these days.
I suppose many people at Grinnell have.  After all, we've just reached
the end of what may be the last "traditional" Grinnell registration,
and we're in the cleanup phase after cuts, closes, and balances.

In case you've forgotten, or in case you never knew, Grinnell has
a different registration system than most institutions: Instead of
employing a priority system or a first-come, first-served system,
at Grinnell, we permit students to "preregister" for their classes
without class caps; then we shuffle things around to deal with the
courses that are overenrolled.  Sometimes we cut students from
overenrolled classes.  We might balance students between sections.
We close other sections to hold slots for the cut students.  Sometimes
we cancel low-enrolled classes altogether and add new sections of
high-demand classes.  And, once in a while, the Dean coughs up some
cash, and we try to find people to teach new sections of high-demand
classes [1].

It's a weird system.  However, it has some significant positives.
From my perspective, one of the central positives is that it's
somewhat agile; if we see demand for a class, we can shift resources
or at least plan resources for a subsequent semester.  But it also
reflects a central institutional value: We don't (or shouldn't)
treat our students as entries in a database.  For example, when
making choices about cutting students from a class, we can often
rely on our knowledge about individual students.   Will a student
be abroad in another semester, making it necessary (or at least
better) that they take the course this semester?  Is a student
completing a complicated double major that creates conflicts?  Does
a student have an upcoming internship that relies on the course
topic?  Has the student been cut from the course in the past?

As a member of a high-demand department, I also know that we rely
on the system to provide a bit of a balancing act.  We don't have
enough slots in CS courses to handle all of the demand; I'm pretty
sure that few small liberal arts colleges do.  So we try to consider
a variety of factors in reshuffling our classes.  For example, we
prioritize everyone making progress in the major over any individual
student getting multiple courses.  We also tend to prioritize
potential majors over students taking our classes for general
interest [2].  For example, a rising second-year undeclared student
is more likely to get into CSC-207 than a rising third-year student
with a declared major in another subject.

Dealing with all of those conflicting issues creates a non-trivial
workload for some faculty and departments.  I don't like the workload
or the work, but I've always thought it was worth it for the
accompanying benefits.

In any case, that's our system.  It's imperfect, but it's individualized.

Or that was our system.  Things are changing.

Some folks, particularly those new to the system, sometimes find it
problematic.  President Harris considers it inequitable, as does
our new Registrar.  What are the inequities?  One obvious one is
that it provides a kind of favoritism; faculty can choose who to
keep and who to drop or who to allow to over-enroll in a class.
Unconscious bias can play a role in that.  It's also the case that
the students with more social capital (or those who have advisors
with more social capital) are more likely to take advantage of the
system. For example, they might know to contact individual faculty
to receive higher priority.  The current system also requires access
to hidden knowledge.  What courses tend to fill?  Who gets priority
when courses fill?

To President Harris, these inequities sufficiently trumped the
strengths of our system that she charged the Registrar to come up
with a new registration system [3].  The first draft was what I'd
call a "seniority plus fcfs system".  That is, seniors first
registered for up to nine credits, then third-years, then second-years,
then first-years [4].  Each of these registrations was first-come,
first-served.  Who can click the "Register" button first for a
high-demand course?  It's like a video game.  After that, there was
a second seniority round for the remaining credits.

Such a system creates a host of problems.  For example, rising
seniors could claim all of the slots in a course that second-year
students need to make progress in the major.  In CS, the discipline
I know best, those could be slots in a fall CSC-161 (for those who
took CSC-151 in the spring) or a fall CSC-207 (for those who took
CSC-161 in the spring).  Or nonmajors could claim the slots in _The
Craft of Fiction_ even though the department might prefer to prioritize
majors.

Fortunately, faculty raised enough objections about the seniority
plus fcfs system that we have a new draft system.  In this system,
we do a short round using our historical preregistration system for
the first nine credits, add a short seniority-based cleanup round,
and then move to seniority plus fcfs for the remaining credits in
the third round.  That is, we begin with a short round in which we
pretend there are no caps on classes and students can register for
up to nine credits.  The Registrar's office then quickly applies
cut and balance rules to what we hope are a relatively small number
of classes.  Students who have been cut (or who forgot to register
in the first round) have a short cleanup round where they can add
classes up to a total of nine credits.  Perhaps others can shift things
around in that round.  That round also uses seniority and fcfs. Finally,
we have a third round of seniority-based fcfs registration for the
remaining credits.

I think this newer system addresses my primary concern.  For example,
if seniors register for CSC-207, they will have lower priority than
rising second-year students, so the latter will get their slots,
provided they know to register for them in the first round.  I do
worry that some students, particularly double majors, may have more
complicated schedules that can be easily broken.  And I worry about
the few critical course pairings, such as BIO-251 and CHM-221 [5],
that need careful arrangement to fit into many schedules.  I guess
we'll see what happens for those students.

Is this new system better or at least more equitable?  I'm not
certain.  Students still need some knowledge of what courses are
likely to fill.  Without such knowledge, how will the know what to
select in the first round?  I suppose they can see courses filling
and shift things around [6], but that assumes they have time to
keep track.  Students will still benefit from "inside knowledge"
about processes and policies, such as which majors you should declare
to ensure priority in certain courses [7,8].  Some students will
still ask about waiving prerequisites.  Is there inequity in waiving
prerequisites?  As long as we're consistent in how we waive
prerequisites, there shouldn't be.  However, some groups of students
may be more likely to ask faculty to waive prereqs.

I'm also unsure whether a first-come, first-served system is truly
equitable.  The current draft has 7 a.m. as an opening time for
registration.  But some student athletes have practices at 7 a.m.
and other students work at 7 a.m., most often in the dining hall.
In addition, not everyone finds it easy to wake up that early.  I
don't know that there's a better time; as far as I can tell, any
time you start registration will cause problems for some students.

On a separate note, I worry about the effects of this system on
diversity in my discipline.  In national discussions among CS
faculty, I've heard that experience and studies suggest that when
resources are tight, underserved students tend to persist less.
Many factors come into play.  For example, those with privilege
tend to be more willing to push for a seat or to wait things out
while those who don't see many people like them may be more likely
to say "I don't really belong" and look elsewhere.  While we are
not permitted to prioritize students from underserved groups
[9,10,11], it feels like we need to do more for them than this
system permits.

I'm sad about the loss of instructor autonomy in deciding who to
take next from the wait list.  It feels to me that taking students
off the wait list is one of the important times that individual
attention comes into play.  Perhaps we can be more equitable in
asking everyone for their story.  But a purely policy-based system
removes individual considerations.  Of course, I should also accept
that "instructor autonomy" can also lead to inequitable choices,
such as my temptation to prioritize students from underserved groups.
I also know that my wait lists are usually first-come, first-served.
It's complicated.

I don't know what the effect will be on "horse trading".  What do
I mean by that?  Currently, we sometimes offer incentives for
students to give up their spot in an over-enrolled class.  For
example, "If you switch from CSC-341 (overenrolled) to CSC-301
(slots available) this semester, we will not only prioritize you
for CSC-341 in the spring but also move you up on the wait list
for CSC-213." [12] Is horse trading the best strategy?  I'm not
sure.  However, it is certainly one way that we address problems
in making sure that all of our students get courses.  It's also a
way of reducing problems down the road; if we don't fill all of our
slots in CSC-301 in one semester, we'll likely be over-enrolled in
the following semester.  With approximately sixty CS majors in each
class year and three sections of CSC-301 each year, each capped
at twenty, we need to fill every seat every semester to prevent
future demand that we cannot meet [14,15].

I worry about the difficulty of writing priority lists for students
coming off waiting lists.  Many factors come into play: Major, class
year, study abroad, whether they've been on waiting lists in the
past, etc.  For a fall CSC-207, I'd give the highest priority to a
rising third-year declared CS major who plans to study abroad in
the spring and who has been cut from CSC-207 in the past.  Of course,
I don't know if any such people exist.  After that, it would be
rising third-year declared CS majors who are studying abroad in the
spring.  Then rising third-year declared CS majors.  (Oh, that's
right; I should separate those previously cut.)  Then rising
second-year students who have been cut in the past [16].  Then other
rising second-year students.  Or should that only be those who do
not already have a declared major?  And then?  Perhaps Statistics
concentrators who need it for their concentration.  Possibly students
who need it for their graduate program [17].  What about rising
third-year intended CS majors?  How do we identify such students?
In any case, we will encounter complications and spend a nontrivial
amount of time to make and agree upon the priority rules.  And I'm
fairly confident that we'll leave off some category.  For example,
what do we do about the student who forgot to register but needs a
course?  Where on the waiting list do they go?  As importantly, who
makes the decision? [18]

There are also priorities I don't know how we'll express or record.  How
do we document (and implement) the policy that it's more important that a
rising third-year student get a course that they need to move forward
in the major than that a senior get the course if they don't need it to
graduate? [19]

Once departments have made policies, Grinnell will have to communicate
prioritization and other information to students.  We've not been
good about doing so in the past.  Can we do better?  Certainly.
Can we do better by this fall's spring registration?  I'm not as
sure.

Of course, I also see positives to the system.  Once we've done the
up-front labor of creating priority lists, we won't have to spend
the effort managing waiting lists.  And when students can't take
classes they want or need, we can blame "the system" rather than
try to find solutions.  Oh. Wait.  That means we're not giving
students the individual attention they deserve.

Having watched the Registrar's office attempt to do CCBs this semester,
I do worry that we're moving toward treating students as boxes, rather
than as individuals.  That may be more equitable, at least in some sense
of equity, but I'm not sure it's more fair [20].

Still, I appreciate the goal of equity.  And if the new system
requires less work, that's a good bonus, too.  In any case, I look
forward to seeing what happens.  I hope it goes well.

**_Postscript_**: I'm glad I'll be on leave and so will only experience
most of the complications indirectly [21].

[1] I don't think it's a good idea to rely on contingent faculty.
If we have predictable needs, we should have more tenure-line
faculty.  Sometimes, the best solution is to ask folks in a shared
contract to expand their teaching; the _Faculty Handbook_ specifies
appropriate compensation (1/5 a year's salary, if I remember correctly).

[2] I wish that every student who wanted to take a CS class---or
even multiple CS courses---could do so.  However, the institution
appears reluctant to provide us with the resources to ensure those
opportunities and, well, no one listens to my complaints about those
issues anymore.

[3] We will, for the time being, set aside the governance issues
involved in that charge.  From my perspective, the President should have
charged the Dean to investigate the issue.

[4] I've forgotten what the additional rules were for mid-year graduates.

[5] I think.

[6] At least, I assume they'll be able to shift courses during each round.

[7] I know of at least one rising third-year intended CS major who
didn't realize that they needed to declare a CS major in order to get
CSC-207 in the fall.

[8] There are groups of students who are very good at sharing this
insider information.

[9] At least I don't think we are.

[10] I have switched to using "underserved" rather than "underrepresented"
to emphasize that it is our responsibility to serve these students,
rather than their responsibility to "represent", as it were.

[11] However, I find it problematic that "underserved" looks far too
close to "undeserved".

[12] That's not exact, but it gives the flavor.

[14] It's a bit more complicated than that.  Some class years 
have more than 60 majors.  Some class years have slightly under
60 majors.  Some students can take a CSC-301 equivalent while abroad,
although it's not one of the more common study-abroad courses.  Some
students need to repeat CSC-301.  And, amazingly, some students who
are not CS majors want to take 301.  In any case, the simplest model
is that in CSC-301 and CSC-324 and CSC-341, we need to fill every seat
every semester or we will find that we have to cut students out of
required courses.

[15] When I started writing this musing on April 10, we still had
slots available in CSC-301.  When I finished musing on April 11, all
the slots in CSC-301 were full.

[16] Those students generally won't be studying abroad in the spring;
most Grinnellians who study abroad do so in their third year.

[17] Yes, some graduate programs (particularly in STEM disciplines)
require that you've had an undergraduate class in Java.

[18] It's not just a hypothetical question.  I have an advisee who forgot
to include one course on their schedule.  They are now on the waiting list
for that course. I hope they are prioritized.

[19] And do we even agree about that policy?

[20] Now that I think about things a bit more, I find that the system 
may be equal but I'm even less sure it's equitable.  I thought
equitable systems meet people where they are, which requires taking
individual situations into account.  Isn't that what [the famous
baseball soapbox
cartoon](https://interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/)
suggests?

[21] Perhaps I should have given up my advisees [22].  Then I'd get to
watch from even further afar.

[22] Perhaps I should not have taken on more.
