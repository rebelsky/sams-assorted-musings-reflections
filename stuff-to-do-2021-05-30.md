Long-time readers may recall that there was a period during which I
regularly posted my too-long lists of tasks.  I've been working hard
to reduce my workload, and I've mostly been succeeding.  However, as
I transition from the regular rhythms of Spring Term Two to the 
less regular rhythms of summer work, I thought it might be helpful to
myself to make a list of things I need to do, or want to do, or whatever.

Research starts next week.  I have not yet planned out the first week
of research.  However, I have sent a note to my students to get them
started.  I should plan what we'll do the first week.  Of course,
planning requires that I know more about what my students do and don't
know, so perhaps some of the planning needs to happen after our first
meeting or meetings.  Usually, we have those initial meetings during
the spring semester; that didn't seem possible this year.  

I'll probably muse about those plans.

It's been a while since I've gotten MIST up and running.  I should make
sure that I know how to do that so that I can help my students do so.

I needed to get my book orders in.  I did that today.  Yay!

I needed to check on a variety of software.  I sent in requests to be
able to use Discord and Ohyay with my research students.  Yes, both are
necessary; I'm charged with helping prepare the community support for
the Tapia Celebration, and Discord and Ohyay are our two most-likely
candidates.  I wonder what ITS will say.  I sent a note to an
Associate Dean to check on the status of GitHub.  I sent a note to 
our Deputy CIO to check on the College's opinion on encrypted email.
It's nice to get things off my list.

Speaking of Tapia, I should move forward on the engagement part.  It's
still not completely clear what I'm supposed to do as engagement chair;
I've gotten mixed answers.  I've also been told "It's a new position that
we created for you; make it your own."  I think I'll focus on community
building for Tapia online.  But I want to survey the Tapia community on
what they want to see.  So I need to work on a survey.

The Film and Media Studies workshop is next week.  I probably need
to do a little prep for that.  I've already filled out the survey.
There's a 35-page article to read, a fifteen-minute film to watch,
and some curricula from peer institutions to review.

While Spring Term Two is over, my responsibilities for the term are
not yet finished.  It appears that I forgot to turn in my syllabi.
And I haven't completed my grading.  I expect to do both between the
time I write this sentence and the time you read it.

I mustn't forget home responsibilities, either.  I've put a few on
my list.  The biggest one right now is to make progress on the 
pit of horror that is my office, especially since the chaos spilled
into the living room a few months ago and I haven't gotten it back
under control.  Maybe an hour per day will permit progress?

I should also keep musing, keep reading, keep exercising, keep
eating well, and such.

Something feels wrong.  There's not enough on my list.  There's
never that little.  I must be missing something.  Or maybe something
is right: I've learned how to be more moderate.  Nah, it can't be
that.  It's probably that it's just summer.

Here's the list I built while thinking through all of that.  As I
said, I don't think it's all that long, and I'm happy that I was
able to check off some boxes.  But I feel like I'm missing something.
