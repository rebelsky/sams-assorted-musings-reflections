As I noted [recently](developmental-reviews-2024-08-15), Grinnell has temporarily replaced post-tenure merit reviews with post-tenure developmental reviews. What's the difference? Merit reviews give you a merit score which affects your salary. Developmental reviews are designed only to encourage faculty to reflect and to provide feedback to help them develop. At least that's the plan.

I'm scheduled for a developmental review this year, so I'm going to undertake the first step of the review: Putting together notes on what I've done the past six years. I suppose it could be for the past three years, since it's part of a triennial review process, but the form asks for six years. Taking notes on what I've done of late will help me get both my Faculty Activities Reports (FARs) and my _Curriculum Vitae_ (CV) up to date.

## 2024--2025 (This year; normal teaching year)

_It's this year. I know what's planned. But plans change. Let me see what I expect to be doing. Or hope to be doing._

**Teaching**

* Two sections of CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and Algorithms_ (both in fall)
* Three sections if CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_ (all in spring)

_I have an awesome chair!_

**Teaching goals/development**

* Convert CSC-207 from 3x80 to 2x110.
* Add some Computing for Social Good (CSG) activities to CSC-207.
* Try to cut workload in CSC-207.
* Continue to refine "Portfolio Specifications Grading" in 207.
* See if I can fit structs into CSC-151.
* Consider whether I can incorporate the Layers game in CSC-151 (most likely as an assignment).
* Consider swapping 151 to Scamper. If I don't do the conversion now, I'll do it during sabbatical [1].

**Advisees**

* Starting the year with 23, nearly twice the College average.

**Heavy service**

* 2025 SIGCSE Technical Symposium (about five hours in the typical week; as many as forty during some high-intensity weeks)
* Chairing a tenure review committee [3]

**Other service**

* Probably some conference reviewing
* Possibly some scholarship reviewing for Tapia and/or GHC
* Department rep to General Science
* Participating in third-year review
* Web Governance Committee (may become heavy service if we really take on all the tasks assigned to us)
* Steering Committee of MINK-WIC 2025 (Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas Celebration of Women in Computing) (a lighter year)
* Continue to support parents on the Grinnell College Parents and Families Facebook group.
* See groundskeeping below.

**Scholarship**

* Co-editor of the 2025 SIGCSE TS Proceedings.

**Groundskeeping**

* Department rep to STARS Alliance
* Department rep to Access Computing
* Hope to start student diversity group. (Unfortunately, many of the students who I had hoped to participate have graduated.)

**Well-being** [4]

* Trying to limit time on campus

**Life events**

* Taking care of Michelle

**Other**

* Continuing to muse.
* Plan to clean out lab.

## 2023--2024 (Normal teaching year)

_Back from sabbatical to a difficult year in the department: Three faculty on leave in the fall, four faculty on leave in the spring. A long-time visitor has left._

**Teaching**

* Two sections of CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_, one in fall and one in spring.
* Two sections of CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and Algorithms_, one in the fall and one in the spring.
* One section of CSC-281, _Learning from Alumni_.

**Teaching goals/development**

* New version of CSC-151 that focuses on image making, pulling together some of the old "Mediascheme" course and some of the newer Racket-based course. Required writing new libraries (some last year), new assignments, autograders, and more.
* Converted CSC-207 to mastery grading.
* Started working on "Portfolio Specifications Grading" in 207.
* Revised 281 to focus more on developing skills for technical interviews.

**Advisees**

* I count about twenty. I don't know what the College counts.

**Heavy service**

* 2024 SIGCSE Technical Symposium (about five hours in the typical week; as many as forty during some high-intensity weeks)

* Michelle had a long hospital stay in summer 2024.
* I'm leaving out my offsprings' graduations and such.

**Other**

* Continuing to muse. I've heard that my musing on the values represented by the Registration process will likely be helpful as we move forward on that topic. I hear that my musing on major declarations in CS was helpful to parents who did not understand why their child could not declare a CS major until their fourth semester.

## 2022--2023 (MAP Leave)

_When Grinnell first developed the Mentored Advanced Project program, supervising MAPs could earn you course releases. In 2017 or so, the College realized how much it owed for MAPs and discontinued that kind of compensation. However, it also converted half-year sabbaticals to full-year sabbaticals for faculty who included student-faculty research as part of their normal work. At the time of the transition, faculty who were owed course releases were given a choice: they could trade each course release for $6000 or so or they could keep their course releases, but then they would not get the new full-year sabbatical until after they had used up their course releases. Since I had earned about seven course releases between MAPs and course overloads, I chose to keep those releases. This year represented my last five course releases. It corresponds to about six summers of full-time work with students._

**Teaching**

_On leave, no teaching._

**Teaching goals/development**

* Prepare for new image-based version of CSC-151.

**Advisees**

* Continued to have advisees, although fewer. I count fourteen or so. I don't know what the College coungs.

**Heavy service**

* SIGCSE TS 2024 service started in December 2022.
* Ran a third-year review.
* Wrapped up service as Engagement Chair and member of Infrastructure Committee for Tapia.

**Other service**

* Participated in two tenure reviews.
* APC for SIGCSE TS 2023
* See groundskeeping below.

**Scholarship**

* Worked on the CSG-Ed chapter for Curriculum 2023.
* Chairing SIGCSE was my primary scholarship.

**Groundskeeping**

* Department rep to STARS Alliance
* Department rep to Access Computing
* Tapia (see above)
* Got funding for students to attend Tapia
* Arranged selection process for students to attend Tapia
* Received innaugural (I think) outstanding service award from the Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing

**Well-being**

* On leave!
* Not enough other

**Life events**

* Michelle diagnosed with multiple myeloma in November 2022.

**Other**

* Continued to muse.

## 2021--2022 (First post-pandemic in-person teaching year)

**Teaching**

* CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_ (four sections, one in fall and three in spring)
* CSC-281, _Learning from Alumni_ (fall)
* CSC-282, _Thinking in C and Unix_ (spring)

## 2020--2021 (Pandemic! Online teaching year)

_A very different year. We planned in-person classes for first-year students and then moved them online. We switched from 14-week semesters to seven-week terms. And, well, it was a pandemic. I'm not sure that I really want to remember this year._

**Teaching**

* Tutorial (Fall 1)
* CSC-151 (Fall 2)
* CSC-281 (Fall 1)

**Well-being**

* Therapy to handle my growing frustration with the College.

**Life events**

* Heart attack in Spring 2021, right between the two terms. Why did I decide to teach in Spring 2? I must have decided that students were counting on me.
* Michelle moved to Audubon.

**Other**

It appears that I have lots of things to enter. Most that belong on my CV are already on my CV. But I haven't updated my FAR in a bit, and many things that aren't on my CV nonetheless belong in my FAR.

My retrospective and prospective reviews will likely focus on SIGCSE TS. How do I explain the work for SIGCSE? Perhaps that will be another musing. But the symposium represents both scholarship (co-editing a 200+-paper volume) and service (organizing the symposium itself).

My retrospective will also include a section on mastery grading. Also a comment on the number of advisees. Perhaps a rant about registration.

I should mention the Tapia award. I'm not sure that anyone at the College will care, but I'm proud that folks felt like I made a difference. (Amazingly, I almost forgot it. That's one of the reasons I decided to work on this musing.) I can also comment on my other BPC work (although I'd like to do more).

Should I discuss my life events? I'm not sure. I blame the College, in part, for my heart attack. (My weight contributes; but my battles with the College as chair also contributed.)

And the musings are important. Agh! So much to write about. Fortunately, the form isn't due until November 4. However, my FAR and CV are part of my leave request, so I need to get those done soon.

[1] That is, of course, assuming that we haven't made changes to the introductory sequence [2].

[2] Changes to the introductory sequence are a topic for another musing.

[3] Even though this is heavy service, it's not something I would normally put on my CV.

[4] The form has "wellbeing", but "well-being" seems to be more common in the US.
