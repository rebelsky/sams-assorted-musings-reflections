For the past few days, Michelle and I have been listening to music together. Music has been a large part of our lives (particularly music while driving), and I thought the music might connect with her as she sleeps.

Today, rather than picking albums we listened to together, I decided to grab her iPhone and see what music she had on it. More precisely, I wanted to see what playlists she had. As I recall, Michelle was somewhat casual in putting together playlists. It was a combination of "What comes to mind now?" and "What do I want to hear again and again?" She didn't have a lot of playlists, so she often listened to the same one each week as she drove to and from Audubon. She also listened to some albums.

In putting together these lists, I'm not sure what commentary I'll decide add. This may just be "Let's explore Michelle's taste." And while the completist in me wants to add careful discographical information, I'm oing to stick with title and artist. Well, title, artist, and a few comments.

## A playlist entitled "First car mix"

"Captain Jack" by _Billy Joel_.

"The Stranger" by _Billy Joel_.

"Only The Good Die Young" by _Billy Joel_.

"One Toke Over the Line" by _Brewer & Shipley_.

"The Leader of the People" by _Charles Steele_.

"Plane to Denver" by _Charles Steele_.

"Levon" by _Elton John_.

"American Idiot" by _Green Day_. A bit of an odd transition here.

"She Is Always Seventeen" by _Harry Chapin_. A Harry Chapin song whose lyrics I don't dislike. Cool.

"Somewhere Far Away" by _Lowen & Navarro_.

"Walking On A Wire" by _Lowen & Navarro_.

"Queen of Argyll" by _Silly Wizard_. Definitely one of her favorite songs. I once asked if she wanted to suggest it for Danika & Jeb, but she said she thought it wouldn't work. Strangely enough, I don't remember her listening to other Silly Wizard.

"Hey St. Peter" by _The Bad Examples_. Ah, one of our favorite bands. And one of those songs that suggests that we didn't necessarily play the most appropriate music for our children ("My life passed before my eyes like an X-rated film"). Also a rocking song that is a somewhat strange transition from "Queen of Argyll".

"Not Dead Yet" by _The Bad Examples_. Yes, another bad example for our children. ("Standing with a Strat, I'm rock and roll's bastard son. Go out, get drunk, get laid, have fun.") Definitely fun car music, though.

"Smiles Like Richard Nixon" by _The Bad Examples_. As you can probably tell by now, Michelle liked grabbing a few songs by the same artist. This song is very different than the other two; much more quietly melodic.

"Trouble Bound" by _The Blasters_. I've mentioned before how much she likes the Blasters as a group and Dave Alvin as a solo artist.

"Marie Marie" by _The Blasters_.

"Hollywood Bed" by _The Blasters_.

"Red Rose" by _The Blasters_.

"Fool's Paradise" by _The Blasters_.

"Blackwater" by _The Doobie Brothers_.

## A playlist entitled "Rowing"

Was this for exercise? I don't know.

"Black Betty" by _Ram Jam_.

"All Star" by _Smash Mouth_.

"Independence Day" by _Martina McBride_. A bit of a transition from the prior two.

"Jackie Blue" by _Ozark Mountain Daredevils_.

"My Sharona" by _The Knack_.

"The Queen of Argyll" by _Silly Wizard_. As I said, this one was a definite fave.

"Amie" by _Pure Prairie League_.

"Walking on a Wire" by _Lowen & Navarro_. Another repeat. Another favorite.

"Welfare Music" by _The Bottle Rockets_. We saw them with the Jollys at Woolys. (Or was that at Jollys with the Woolys?) This is a boppy little piece with a somewhat sad theme.

"Grace" by _The High Kings_. Middle Child introduced Michelle to The High Kings. She clearly enjoyed their music.

"The Green Fields of France" by _The High Kings_. The first (and only) duplicate in this list.

## A playlist entitled "Travel"

I'm relatively sure that this was her primary "music to listen to" for the first few months (year?) of her time working in Audubon.

"Border Radio" by _Dave & Phil Alvin & The Guilty Ones_. I said I wasn't going to include discographical information, but this one seems worth noting. It's from a recording of the brothers on 24 October 2014. that [I found on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/DA2014-10-24). Dave is generous in permitting recording of his live shows to be posted to archive.org. And this was from a tour in which the brothers were back together. (We saw a show on one such tour; I'm not sure if it was this one.)

"What's Up With Your Brother" by _Dave & Phil Alvin & The Guilty Ones_. Same show. A great new song introduced at about the time of the tour. I love the lyric "I'll debate time and space and _the theory of numbers_. But all anyone asks is What's Up With Your Brother?" (In addition to being a great singer, Phil is a mathematician.)

"Marie Marie" by _Dave & Phil Alvin & The Guilty Ones_. Like "Border Radio", an album from about 30 years before the show. Still amazingly rocking.

"Fox on the Run" by _The Sweet_. Yes, they had songs other than "Ballroom Blitz".

"Lake Shore Drive" by _Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah_. Since I lived on the South side, "Heading South on Lake Shore Drive" always seemed backwards (or upside-down).

"Bring It On Home To Me" by _Sam Cooke_.

"Surrender" by _Cheap Trick_.

"Father and Son" by _Cat Stevens_. She's mixing it up here, not staying with any artist for more than one song.

"Praise The Lord" by _Poi Dog Pondering_. I remember seeing them together; they are such a fun collective. We listened to a lot of PDP (no, not DEC PDP) during our drives back and forth in New Hampshire and Maine. This didn't strike me as an obvious choice of a PDP song, but it's a nice one.

"Freakin' At The Freaker's Ball" by _Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show_. Proof that Michelle and I aren't the only ones who let their kids listen to songs with inappropriate lyrics. (Both Michelle and I loved this album as children.) Let's see ... "Everybody ballin' in batches. Pyromaniacs strikin' matches. I'm gonna itch me where it scratches. Freakin' at the Freaker's Ball." You gotta love Shel Silverstein.

"Wham Bam Shang-A-Lang" by _Silver_. Hmmm. A song I didn't know well.

"Black Swan" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_. A great "custom song". I hope our custom song will eventually end up on an album, too.

"Some Kind of Wonderful" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Rainy Day Lovin'" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Mr. Know It All" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Time for a Change" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_. Have you seen a pattern yet? Michelle added all of _Balance, Vol. 1_ to this playlist.

"Without Love" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Superstition" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_. Such a great song. And such a great cover. However, I'll admit that I prefer their more recent live performances of this song.

"Intermission" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Breathe In, Let Go" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_. As our friend John says, this is a real snot-sobber. 

"Put Your Records On" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Half As Strong As You" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_. Another snot-sobber, increasingly so for me as time goes on.

> Are you sleeping? 

> Do you know it's me?

> Can you feel my hand in yours?

> You're the one I still adore.

> This is me that's _someth_ing you.

> You're mostly unresponsive.

> But you're still fighting.

> Because we're not ready to say goodbye.

> I don't know if you can hear me.

> But I believe you can feel me.

> Just like I feel you.

Whoops. I shouldn't have tried to transcribe the lyrics. Now I'm crying. I hope you're not.

"Bluebird" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Press Play" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"2020" by _Mitch Rossell_. I know not where this one came from.

## A playlist entitled "New Travel"

"Mr. Know It All" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_. Michelle really enjoyed listening to Danika and Jeb since we started doing our remote dates. Their _Day #2349_ served as a regular "album playlist", as it were.

"Harlan County Line" by _Dave Alvin_. Also a song that Michelle requested that Danika and Jeb cover.

"Johnny Ace is Dead" by _Dave Alvin_. And we're back to the "multiple songs by one artist" theme.

"What's Up with Your Brother?" by _Dave Alvin_. This time, from the _Eleven Eleven_ album.

"Gary, Indiana 1959" by _Dave Alvin_. Union songs!

"Praise the Lord" by _Poi Dog Pondering_.

"Ex-Wives" from _The Soundtrack to Six_. Michelle loved this soundtrack. The soundtrack was a common alternative to playlists when we were driving, at least since about the time of the pandemic. I'm glad we got to see the show together.

"Get Down" from _The Soundtrack to Six_.

"What's Up with Your Brother?" by _Dave Alvin_. This time, from the _Eleven Eleven_ album. You can't have too many repetitions of a song that discusses the theory of numbers.

"Make My Own Day (Live)" by _Danika & The Jeb_.

"Black Rose of Texas" by _Dave Alvin_. Michelle told me that she loved the lyrics of this sad, sad song.

"Blinded by the Sun" by _Giulia Milanta_. Another artist we listen to together on StageIt. (Danika and Jeb are the main ones.)

"Queen of Argyll" by _Silly Wizard_. How many playlists is this on?

"They Call Her Easy" by _Harry Chapin_. Ugh. Do we really need a story about a father's hope for his daughter and the person who lets him down?

"Sway Into The Storm (Live)" by _Danika & The Jeb_.

"In A Memory" by _Danika Holmes featuring Jeb Hart_.

"Our Three Sons" by _Danika & The Jeb_. My thirty-fifth anniversary present to her. (No, not the sons, the song.)

---

Hmmm ... that's all I can find on this phone. I know that there were others. She loved 1970's pop and rock and often had that music playing. For example, I expected to see "Brandy (You're A Fine Girl)", which I regularly heard while riding with her. Or maybe she just played _Have A Nice Day: Super Hits of the 70's_. I can't reproduce everything. These four tapes give a partial start to Michelle's taste, my encounters with her taste, and our shared enjoyment.

What about the albums on her iPhone, the ones that served as alternates to playlists? I've mentioned a few, but we'll consider those in more depth in another musing.
