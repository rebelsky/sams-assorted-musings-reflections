It may not surprise you to hear that I have friends at other small
liberal arts colleges [1].  One of them asked me to tell a story
about them.  To preserve their identity, I should choose a nice,
gender-neutral name.  I know!  I'll use "Sam", which could stand
for Samantha or Samuel or something else.  Sam teaches at Smileville
College [2], an elite liberal arts college much like Grinnell.  And
when I say it's much like Grinnell, I mean that they have a talented
faculty, dedicated to both teaching and scholarship, they care
deeply about inculcating their students in the liberal arts, and
stuff like that [3].

Like many SLACs these days, Smileville has seen a growth in
institutional bureaucracy and, more particularly, in risk management.
It's not surprising; new laws and policies have significantly
affected most institutions, and more administrative support is
necessary.

A few years ago, the risk managers at Smileville stumbled upon a
key piece of information.

> Images have power.

Yes, that's something most of us know.  Images carry surprising power,
including the power to harm, as is immediately evident to Jews who've been 
confronted with swastikas or iron crosses, Black Americans who've been
confronted with nooses, Muslims who've been confronted with images
of Muhammad, and many, many more.  Images also have the power to
inspire, to amuse, to educate, to confuse, to encourage or discourage,
to clarify or obfuscate, to change.

Smileville's risk managers, in reflecting on these issues, came up
with their own phrase.

> Images carry risk.

Unsurprisingly, they came up with many ways in which images carry
risk to the institution.  Some images can harm students or faculty,
as I suggested above.  Some images are likely to offend others,
which may lead to protests or lawsuits or even violence.  Do you
want to defend the use of images of a nude body?  They don't.  Some
images carry the risk of copyright or trademark violation.  With
recent changes in the NCAA, risk managers also worry about Name,
Image, and Likeness [5].

Smileville is not alone in worrying about images.  A school board
voted to [paint over a mural by Victor Arnautoff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/san-francisco-board-of-education-votes-to-paint-over-schools-george-washington-mural/2019/06/27/77e00446-982f-11e9-b503-8e101553431a_story.html), a protege of Diego Rivera, one of the great muralists of the early
20th century.  The Student Government at the Catholic University of America
voted to [remove a painting of Christ that resembles George Floyd](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/catholic-university-student-government-votes-to-remove-painting-depicting-george-floyd-as-jesus-christ/) [6].

What happened at Smileville?  The risk managers and other administrators
did what all good bureaucrats do.  They wrote institutional policies.
Better yet, they got the President and Dean to write a letter to
all faculty and staff that said [8],

> Learning from a significant number of students that they are being asked to use too many different images in their work, many of them beyond what the College supports, prompts us to reach out to you for a reset in our shared understanding of image use.

> As new risks and liabilities come to light, we write with a sincere and urgent request that all faculty and staff members of Smileville College heed the College policies that prohibit the use of unapproved images. A summary of the importance of this request has been posted in SmileyShare, but we would like to underscore its urgency.

>  We are fortunate to be in an institution whose financial resources are enabling us to respond quickly, compassionately, and effectively to the global pandemic. The financial vitality of our institution, however, also makes us a potential target. This added risk may seem hyperbolic to some, but in our current environment, we think it wisest to take a defensive posture to protect our academic enterprise, and to do all we can to prevent the possibility of an event that could sabotage our teaching, expose the College and faculty and staff members to liability, and, no less importantly, compromise our resources at a time of crisis.

> We realize that this request may put some of you under additional pressure if you are considering or using images that are not approved. But this really cannot be optional.

> Violating this College policy would mean faculty and staff would forfeit support by the College [9].

> For the time being, the College has arranged licenses for all Smileville community members to use the images of Thomas Kinkade, Painter of Light.  We expect those should suffice for your purposes.

You remember my friend, Sam?  Sam teaches Art History, so Sam cares
a lot about images.  Sam and their colleagues have a huge collection
of images that they have gathered for classroom use over time.  And,
unsurprisingly, Art History students need exposure to images beyond
those of Thomas Kinkade.

But that's okay.  Smileville set up a mechanism by which faculty
could apply for approval of other images through the College's Image
Taboo Safety (ITS) group.  Here's how that works.  You fill out a
multi-page form, explaining your intended use of the image.  You submit
the form  You wait.  You wait some more.  In some situations, you get
follow-up questions.  Sam thinks they send the requests out to lawyers
for approval.  The College discusses contracts with the image
owner [10].  Eventually, you may hear something back [12].

After hearing me report on Anne Harris' uses of Peter Bruegel the
Elder's [_The (Great) Tower of
Babel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower_of_Babel_(Bruegel)),
Sam had been using the work in their classes.  And so they submitted
a request.  It seemed straightforward.  Bruegel has been dead for centuries.
It's a famous work, used by many art historians. 

Amazingly, they got a quick reply.

> Thomas Kinkade has many paintings of towers, such as the Tower Bridge
  in London, the Water Tower in Chicago, and even the Tower of
  David.  We do not think another image of a tower is necessary for
  our students' education.  And students struggle when you rely on
  multiple artists.  Remember, less is more.

The story of Sam's back and forth with ITS about _The Tower of Babel_
is long and complicated enough that I'll leave it for another time.
However, I will share one thing that Sam said to me at the time.

> I understand that they care about risks.  Do they not care about
  the risks to the quality of education our students receive?

Then things got worse.  The Chief Image Officer sent email to faculty
and staff indicating that they would be terminated if they used
unapproved images.  ITS released "clarifications" on the policy
that indicated, among other things, that faculty and staff could
not even recommend images that had not been approved (e.g., it
seemed that you could not say, "If you visit the Des Moines Art
Center, you should check out Francis Bacon's _Study After
VelÃ¡zquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X_"); that images created by
faculty, staff, and students could not be used in class; and that
those images could also not be shared with people outside the
institution.  It might not surprise you to hear that the folks
in Studio Art were also unhappy with these policies [14].

Sam complained about all of these changes, but especially the first,
which violates academic freedom.  And Sam was somewhat successful.
They got the "clarification" about the ability to recommend images
removed.  Eventually, all of the clarifications disappeared, along
with a promise that clearer clarifications would appear.  But Sam
tells me,

> It's been more than a year since the "clarifications" went away.
  We haven't received a new set.  That suggests to me that the College
  still doesn't want us to use or share the images we create.  I
  think we deserve real clarifications, particularly since the
  College has said it will not stand behind us.

There may be other improvements.  I hear that faculty and staff can
now use unapproved images without the risk of termination.  However,
the institution insists that the faculty and staff, rather than the
institution, accept all liability.  I find that puzzling.  Smileville
stands behind faculty in the books and textbooks they choose for
their courses [15].  Smileville stands behind faculty in the research
they choose to pursue, even if they choose to pursue research in
controversial areas [16].  Why can't Smallville [17] stand behind
their choice of images in their teaching, scholarship, and service?

Sam appears to feel similarly.  In a recent conversation, they said,

> I'm a professional.  I should be treated as such.  However, my
  president and dean have said that they don't trust my decisions
  _in my area of expertise_.  What do I need to do to convince
  our leadership that they have an obligation to express confidence
  in us?

I'm an idiot.  You've heard that before.  You've seen evidence of it
in multiple situations.  This situation is yet another.  In particular,
I said, 

> From what you tell me, you greatly respect your president.  And
  they are an academic who should support academic freedom and
  respect faculty as professionals.  Perhaps they don't know about
  your frustrations and concerns; after all, you've generally expressed
  them to lower-level administrators.  Why don't you contact the
  president directly?

Sam did, hopefully [18].

The response did not live up to their hopes [19].  To paraphrase,

> Images are out of my realm of expertise.  I defer to the CSI [20]
and the IRGC [21] on such issues.

I know Sam plans to follow up with the faculty reps on those
committees after Winter break.  But Sam worries about Smileville,
and I worry about Sam.

I'll end with two recent comments I heard from Sam.  The first
reflects Sam's concerns about Smileville.

> I still don't understand how our administration does not seem to
  consider the risks to our academic program.  Colleagues in my
  department lost a summer of research waiting for ITS to approve
  images.  And one of the best damn folks to teach our 20th-century
  political images class refuses to teach it anymore because they
  will not accept the associated risks and because they still
  remember that threat of termination.  These policies, as implemented,
  have made us a lesser institution.

The second reflects my concerns about Sam, who has always been
passionate about Smileville.

> I used to wonder how faculty became deadwood, particularly at
  Smileville, where I see committed colleagues, dedicated to the
  institutional mission and enthusiastic about working with our
  amazing students.  But just as trees die without sufficient
  nutrition, faculty enthusiasm and energy perish without sufficient
  respect and support.

I have my fingers crossed that Sam's post-break emails will have
an effect.

Hopefully.

**_Postscript_**: You may wonder how I can say that images have
power when I rarely use images in my musings.  Here's a little
secret,

> Words have power, too.

Don't tell the risk managers [22].

[1] "SLACs", in acronym parlance.

[2] Not to be confused with Smallville College or Smallville
University.

[3] I should probably not write mission statements for either institution [4].

[4] Amusingly enough, I was involved in the re-write of Grinnell's
mission statement some years back.  I think that was inspired by a trustee
who wanted to turn the mission statement into a bulleted list.

[5] Who chooses "NIL" as an acronym for something that has value?

[6] Fortunately, someone stole it instead [7].  Then someone else stole
the copy they put up.

[7] That "fortunately" is sarcasm, folks.

[8] The following is slightly paraphrased.

[9] President P and Dean D.  7 April 2020.  "Academic Continuity
for Tuesday, April 7, 2020".  Email to Smileville College community.

[10] I'm not quite sure what they do for images in the public domain [11].

[11] Sam tells me that ITS and the Risk Managers suggest that even if a
painting is in the public domain, a photograph of the painting may not be.

[12] Sam tells me that responses are quicker these days, and the
ITS staff are doing their best to be helpful in the context of the
problematic policies.

[14] Or they would have been if they were paying attention.  One of the
"interesting" issues in the whole situation is that very few of the
clarifications were announced; they just showed up as changes in an
online document.

[15] At least I assume they do.

[16] At least I hope they do.

[17] Whoops.  I made the mistake, too.

[18] That is not, "I hope Sam contacted their president."  That is,
"Sam contacted their president, with hope."

[20] Committee for the Support of Instruction, not Crime Scene
Investigators.

[21] Sam had to look that one up.  It's the "Image Risk Governance
Committee".

[22] Too late.  New policies are already in play.
