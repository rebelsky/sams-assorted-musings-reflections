This coming Sunday, the amazing and incomparable [Danika and the
Jeb](https://danikaandthejeb.com) are playing their first-ever
[Beatles cover
show](https://www.stageit.com/danika_the_jeb/the_beatles_1968_1970_one_show_only/98258).
It's not that they haven't covered the Beatles before.  In fact,
their cover of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" was a hit on Sirius
XM radio (or something like that).

I love Danika and the Jeb's originals.  But I also like their covers.
And Jeb's solos [1] on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" are always amazing
and always different [2,3].  I'm still waiting for them to just do
that song for one of the whole 45-minute [StageIt
shows](https://www.stageit.com/danikaandthejeb) [4].

In any case, in preparation for the show, Danika wrote to their
[Patreon community](https://www.patreon.com/danikaandthejeb/posts)
asking about Beatles-related memories.  My muse decided that I should
respond in this form.  Most of my memories are comparatively small
and relatively fragmentary.  Let's go.

My earliest memory of the Beatles is probably when mom came home
from school one day with a stack of Beatles records which one of
her students gave her to give me [5].   I'm not sure I recall why.  But
I suddenly had copies of _Something Else_, _Yesterday and Today_
[6], and a bunch of other albums, most on the wonderful old Capitol
rainbow label.  I must have been a bit five.  I listened to them a
lot on one of our old KLH record players.  I'm pretty sure I still
have them buried in the vinyl room in the basement.

I'm not sure why, but I remember when I bought _Let It Be_ [7].  For
some reason, I most recall listening to it at my friend Erik Klauber's
house.  As I said, these are fragments.

I don't remember when the Beatles broke up.  Or maybe I heard about
it when I was at Erik's house.  The memories are jumbled.  Although
I don't remember the break-up, I do remember talking to friends about
what a replacement Beatles would look like.

I remember the whole "Paul is Dead" craze.  And yes, I did play
"Revolution Number 9" backwards on my stereo and heard "Turn me
on dead man".  I may even have a tape recording of it somewhere.
It's amazing how much easier that is now.  I guess it would have
been easier then if I'd had a reel-to-reel to play with; I'm
pretty sure that's what the Beatles did.

I remember the day John died.  We were sitting in the lounge in
the Village [8].  Friends cried.  And then the Beatles were on the
radio, nonstop.  I think another five years passed before I could
listen to the Beatles again [9].

I remember when my oldest friend [10], [Andy], gave me a copy of
_Meaty, Beaty, Big, and Bouncy_.  No, it's not a Beatles album;
it's the Who.  But I remember it because of my response: "It's a
greatest hits album, and it's still not as good as the average
Beatles alum." I'm not sure I still feel the same way today.  I
wonder if Andy still plays a Rickenbacker [11].

I'm not sure why, but I remember getting copies of the Red Album
and the Blue Album at that record store in Newton Center.  How old
was I?  I'm not sure; I think it was in junior high.

I remember when Eldest Son was born, and for some reason, I kept
singing "I Saw [Him] Standing There" to him.  My heart definitely
went "Boom" meeting him here.  I'm glad that he coped with my
out-of-tune voice and my choice of music.  I'm pretty sure the other
songs I sang to him regularly were "[Eldest] is a Punk Rocker" and
probably "I Wanna Be Sedated".  There may have been a Clash song
in there, too.  But I sang them to him in Michelle's room in the
hospital, in the second-floor apartment in Maine, and maybe even
in Hanover.

Strangely enough, even though I saw Paul McCartney live in Des Moines,
I have no memories of that show.  Memories from childhood, though
fragmentary, seem more powerful.

In any case, those are my primary Beatles-related memories.  I'm sure
others will spring to the surface soon after I post this musing.

[1] Should that be "The Jeb's solos"?

[2] There's a snowflake joke there, somewhere.

[3] I have not heard all of them; I can't guarantee that they are all
different.  But I've certainly seen and heard a lot of different 
solos.

[4] Hint, hint.

[5] I think mom regularly asked her students for music advice.  I
recall one birthday she took their advice to get me the Who's _Tommy_
and Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show's _Sloppy Seconds_.  I've always
wondered whether they were trying to pull her leg.  A rock opera that
begins with a murder and an album about sex and drugs.  Great gifts
for the seven-or-so-year-old kid I was.  Strangely enough, Michelle
also got _Sloppy Seconds_ at a relatively young age.  And we played
it for our kids, to continue the tradition.

[6] No, not the butcher cover.

[7] Yes, I'm old enough to remember it from when it came out.

[8] No, not the location from _The Prisoner_; the hippy-dippy learning
community for some subset of advanced students at Newton North.

[9] It wasn't sadness about John; it was overexposure.  I wouldn't
have guessed such a thing was possible.

[10] Perhaps "Longest Serving".  We don't see each other much, but I've
known Andy since, um, before I was five.  Strangely enough, I recently
had a dream about seeing him in his parents' house.  Are we still friends?
I still think of  him as one; I hope he thinks the same of me.  But
as I check out [his website](http://www.andrewchalfen.com), I realize
that I haven't been paying attention to what he's been doing for far
too long.

[11] Andy was the lead guitarist of the Wishniaks [12] and the
Trolleyvox, among other things.

[12] Jangle pop!
