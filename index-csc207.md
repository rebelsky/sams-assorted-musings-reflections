# CSC-207

CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and Algorithms_, is the third course in Grinnell's introductory sequence. It contains the material I often think of as belonging in the traditional "CS2" course, along with some more details about object-oriented programming. I first taught a similar class at Grinnell back in the fall of 1997. At the time it was numbered CSC-152.
