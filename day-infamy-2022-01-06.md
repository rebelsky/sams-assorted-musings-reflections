Today we take a break from our regularly scheduled [1] musings and rants
about my life, particularly my life in academia, to consider a somewhat
larger issue, the date.

Today is the 6th of January 2022.  A year ago, misguided people invaded
our halls of liberty, attempting to disrupt the workings of democracy.
some were armed.  Many showed little respect for those halls of liberty,
physically.  All of them showed more than disrespect for the orderly
workings of democracy.

Perhaps it shouldn't have been a surprise.  I expect that many of them
regularly venerate traitors to our country, seen most often by the
flying of the traitorous flag [2].  And I expect that many of them
embrace the myth of the second amendment that the people of our
great country should be ready for armed rebellion at the drop of a
hat [3].

But it should be terrifying.

What should be even more terrifying is that our elected leaders,
those pledged to protect our country, are not unanimous in decrying
this attack on democracy.  And a former president, pledged to uphold
democracy, is at the forefront of the claims that led to this
rebellion [4].

We may not agree about much in our country.  We may never have
agreed about much.  But I thought we agreed on respect for democracy.

So let us let January 6 be another day that lives in infamy.

**_Postscript_**: In this musing, as everywhere, I speak for myself
and not for my institution.  I also realize that some students may be
concerned that I hold different political views than they do.  That
is inevitable.  Know that I will not hold your political views
against you in your work.   After all, some of my best friends are
Republicans.  Some are even Trumpians.

[1] More accurately, "regularly unscheduled" or "irregularly scheduled".

[2] It is hard to dispute that the members of the Confederacy were
traitors to the United States.  At the same time, members of the
United States in the late 1700s were traitors to the English
monarchy.  Sometimes revolution is necessary.  But that doesn't make
you any less of a traitor.

[3] Perhaps that's not a myth; it may be what the founders intended.
I just consider it inappropriate for the 21st century.

[4] I make no comment on whether or not that president encouraged
the rebellion.  However, his unfounded claims about the theft of the
election were key to the rebellion.  It appears that many of the
traitors thought they were acting on his orders.
