It's been two weeks since my heart attack.  Well, slightly less than
two weeks.  My heart attack was in the late evening.  I'm writing
this musing [1] in the early evening.  I've already [mused about the
event and the immediate aftermath](time-for-a-change-2021-03-27).  I
think it's time to muse a bit about how things are going.

Brain is not functioning as well, but it's still functioning.  Some
things seem harder to bring to the forefront.  For example, the traditional 
malloc example I use in 282 was harder to bring to mind.  On the other
hand, I could look at [an example from K&P](...) and think of how to
adapt it to class.

Trying to avoid Grinnell stress.  It's hard.  Being treated rudly by
an administrator and then getting ghosted by the same administrator
makes me upset.  Arguing with an administrator I highly respect is no
fun.  I'm trying to ignore it.  And I'm trying to stay away from
administrative stuff.  I will not serve as chair for the rest of the
year [2].  I will not attend tomorrow's faculty meeting; if I can help
it, I will not attend any meetings for the remainder of the semester.

I decided to teach.  Teaching adds a bit of stress to my life, but it
adds significantly more joy.  Plus, it's an excuse to write.

In Cardiac Rehab.

Walking outside of that, too.

Watching what I eat, particularly saturated fats and sodium.  I'm not
always doing that as well as I should.  (Whoops.  forgot to check the
can of tuna.)
