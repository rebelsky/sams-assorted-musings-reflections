As many of my readers know, I'm trying to take a step back from the
things that stress me.  I'm mostly succeeding.  But I'm also someone
who gets bothered by little things, attacked relentlessly by Emerson's
hobgoblins [1] and other pesky creatures of the subconscious.  I
got up at 10 a.m. this Sunday morning.  It's not yet 11 a.m., and
I'm already tangling with two of them.  My muse insists that I will
best slay them if I write about them [2] and post immediately.  So
here goes.

As I was skimming my email this morning, I saw that I had email from
_The New York Times_ entitled "\[Bulk Mail\] Your Coronavirus Tracker".
I'm not sure why I'm getting this email; I don't recall subscribing
to it.  Perhaps a my family member subscribed with my email address.
In any case, I read through the information contained therein.  And I was 
struck by the oddity of the following.

> The average number of new cases in Poweshiek County fell to **one** yesterday, a **17 percent decrease** from the day before. [8,9]

I wasn't sure how you drop seventeen percent and arrive at one.  The math
doesn't work out.  So I ignored it and read on.

> The average number of new cases in Audubon County reached **zero** yesterday, a **29 percent increase** from the day before. [10]

How can zero be an "increase"?  I showed it to statistician son and was
treated to an amazing expression.

What is _The Times_ doing with such bad statistics (or, more
precisely, such bad presentation of statistics)?  Isn't _The Times_
a great innovators in statistical journalism?  I have no
idea.

And in case you're wondering, the "obvious" explanation is that
there was one case the prior day, but under four the past week, so
the average was zero but it was still an increase.  Still, I can't
make the math work out.  Can you?

Just as I was sitting down to muse about these troublesome data, a
subconscious reminder went off.  I needed to send in my proxy vote
in support of the First-Year Experience Course [11], or more
precisely, in support of (a) regularizing FYEC [18] and (b) adding
FYEC to Grinnell's relatively small list of graduation requirements
[19].

But it's me.  I like to look at the details of the things I'm supporting.
And I'm glad I did.  For example, I learned that we've moved FYEC from
Fall to Spring, at least for most students [20].  And then I saw the
following sentence.

> To be eligible for graduation, a student must have at least 124 credits, a 2.00 cumulative grade point average (GPA), and must have satisfactorily completed the tutorial, \[the First-Year Experience Course\] a departmental, interdepartmental or independent major and the College residency requirement.

I cringed.  Did you?  Why not?  Do you not experience hobgoblins?
First of all, there should be a comma after the new "First-Year
Experience Course"; it's part of a list.  But it's worse than
that.  There are three---count 'em **three**---nested comma-separated
lists in that one sentence: one for the things a student must do,
one for the things a student must satisfactorily complete, and one
for the types of majors.  The outermost list uses an Oxford comma,
but the inner ones do not.  The three parts of the outermost list
are not parallel.  It's difficult to tell that "at least" modifies
not only "124 credits", but also "a 2.0 cumulative grade point
average" (and grade-point should be hyphenated).  

I don't know about you, but if I had a Tutorial [22] student write
a sentence like that, I'd make them rewrite it.  Twice.

I don't blame the proposal's authors.  They had a bad sentence to
start with and likely wanted to minimize changes.  But at some
point, you have to accept that something is broken and needs someone
to fix it.  That someone should not be me; Grinnell has scores of
better writers [23].  But, for the sake of this musing, or for the
sake of my muse, I will attempt the rewrite.  Here goes.  And yes,
it's at least my second attempt.

> To be eligible for graduation a student must earn at least a 2.00 cumulative grade-point average (GPA) and satisfactorily complete at least 124 credits, the tutorial, the First-Year Experience Course, a major (departmental, interdepartmental, or independent), and the College's residency requirement.

It's not great writing.  It may not even be good writing.  But it's
likely up to snuff for policy writing and, more importantly, it's
better than what we had before.  However, as I said, a better writer
would write it better.  I hope someone does so before Monday.

I wish I could be done now.  I sincerely do.  But now another critter is
bouncing around the back of my skull saying,

> That statement is inaccurate!  Students can't just complete an
  arbitrary 124 credits.  We have *restrictions*!  What about the
  limits on counting credits taken while in high school, even if
  those credits are taken at Grinnell?  What about the limits on
  counting practica?  On counting credits in a division?  On counting
  credits taken in a department?  On other criteria I forget?  

> Should we not add another parenthetical after "124 credits"?

It's bad enough that the critter made me go back and edit its statement
to replace "credits" with "counting credits" since students can, say, take
as many credits in a department as they like, but can only count 48 
toward the 124 for graduation.  It's worse that another critter started
challenging the "limits in a department" since there are exceptions to
policies for credits in dual-topic departments.  And another one wants
to rant about the trouble CS and Math had with getting exemptions when,
say, Chinese and Japanese did not seem to.  It also wants to look into
whether Statistics courses are included within the Mathematics caps.
They are different disciplines, aren't they?

Fortunately, I have an ally [24].  That ally is a phrase.  "It's not
my responsibility."  Smooosh!  The critters are gone.

_Thanks hobgobs and other crits.  I enjoyed today's challenges.  I
hope you get to spend some time out in the sun today.  I know that
I will._

**_Postscript_**: As is often the case, I asked Grammarly to rview
this musing.  I don't always agree with Grammarly but it's good for
a quick check on some of the bad habits I fail to quash.  However,
Grammarly often makes itself an irritant.  I would never write "I 
received *a* mail".  Why should I write "I received *an* email"?
Perhaps "an email message".  However, that's overly verbose.

---

**_Postscript_**: I appreciate that Grammarly suggested inserting
a comma before "and the College residency requirement".

---

**_Postscript_**: I hope I didn't screw up the endnotes too much
this time.  I know that "Dad's screwed-up endnotes" serve in the
ranks of my offsprings' hobgoblins.

[1] "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."

[2] "My muse says I should muse" seems awkward.

[3] I don't think the "\[Bulk Mail\]" was part of the original
subject line.  Most likely, one of our the many elements of our
suite of email products added it [4].

[4] Somewhere in the back of my mind, another of those pesky
creatures started saying "Changing email violates the Academic
Computer Use Policy."  But when I took a quick look at the
ACUP [5,6], I couldn't find the phrase the creature suggested but
found the following under subpolicy B9.

> Users may not send anonymous mail, mail with altered headers giving erroneous information ( e.g., an erroneous "sender" name), or anonymous files from anywhere on campus.

However, while adding "\[Bulk Mail\]" to the subject is altering the
header, calling the mail "Bulk Mail" is probably not erroneous.

And yes, the extra space after the open parenthesis is in the original.

I think the ACUP was last revised after the Plans debacle.  It's probably
time to revise it again.

[5] Academic Computer Use Policy.

[7] Isn't that an insanely long URL?  I thought part of the Website
redesign was intended to reduce long URLs.

[9] Boldface in original.

[10] See prior endnotes.

[11] I struggle to properly hyphenate "First-Year Experience Course".
"First-Year" modifies "Experience" and so should be hyphenated.
But "First-Year Experience" modifies "Course", rather than "First-Year"
modifying "Experience Course" [12].  By the traditional rules for
grouping adjectives, it should be "First-Year-Experience Course" [14]
but that scans awkwardly.  I bow to the College's new custom
of eliding the second hyphen [15].

[12] I must admit that the Course does sound like an experience.
And the proposal does say "The FYE Course is experiential".  But
the use of "FYE" does suggest that "Experience" is tied to "First-Year"
not "Course".

[14] Damn hobgoblins!

[15] I note that the proposal includes two different hyphenations,
sometimes listing it as "First Year Experience Course" and sometimes
as "First-Year Experience Course" [16].  The title also appear as
"FYE Course", which avoids the problem altogether.

[16] The authors of the proposal must not encounter hobgoblins.
Their minds are larger [17] than mine.  It must be nice not to have
those hobgoblins.

[17] Less little?

[18] FYEC is a shorthand for "First-Year Experience Course".  I thought
we'd used it in the past, but I don't see it in the proposal.  Maybe I'm
the only one who uses it.

[19] I'm not going to list them here.  I'll be quoting them in a moment.

[20] A student who takes a leave in the spring of the first year
of their Grinnell career has to take it the next year they are on
campus.  Transfer students don't have to take FYEC [21].

[21] Reasons it's good that I'm not attending Faculty Meetings, take
5,124: If I were at the meeting, I'd ask why we're not requiring FYEC
or an equivalent for transfer students, too.  We do so for Tutorial.

[22] I know that the convention is to write "tutorial" with an initial
lowercase "t".  I still insist that when we say "Tutorial" at Grinnell,
we are using it as a proper noun, and it properly deserves an initial
capital.

[23] It also has some amazing writers of scores, but that's a separate
matter.

[24] Not to be confused with "a11y", which is how some computer folks tend
to discuss "accessibility" [25].

[25] I'll let you guess or DDG [26] "i18n".

[26] "Duck Duck Go" or "Dude, Don't Google!".
