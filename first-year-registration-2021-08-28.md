We've just gotten through registration for incoming first-year
students (and a few others).  It's always a complicated process at
Grinnell.  It was more so than normal this year.  Particularly since
some parents on the "Grinnell Parents and Families" Facebook page
seem to want some more information [1], I thought I'd attempt to
provide a bit of perspective.

_Note: As you can tell from the disclaimer at the bottom of the
page, this document represents my personal perspective and is not
the official stated position of Grinnell College._

Let's start with some background about the process.

Fifty years ago [2], Grinnell's faculty voted to do away with general
education requirements to move to a model in which students work
carefully with faculty members to design individualized curricula,
providing each student with a customized liberal arts education.
At the time, the faculty called it the "no requirements curriculum".
For most of the past fifty years, it's been called the "open
curriculum".  That's also the term that, other institutions---say,
Hamilton and Brown---use for their similar curriculum.  Since the
curriculum is not truly open; it requires negotiation and design,
we more recently moved to the longer, but perhaps more accurate,
"individually advised curriculum".

Doing without general education requirements makes a lot of things
more difficult.  If you know that every student is going to take,
say, mathematics and a foreign language, you can often pre-set parts
of each student's curriculum.  As importantly, you have a clear
notion of what the demand for courses will be.  And you can
probably do advising remotely: "You have one spare slot; what would
you like to take?"

We can't do that.  We need to help students get some sense of a
liberal arts education before they select courses for their first
semester.  And that works best in person.  Otherwise, you get those
students who think it's okay to take only science courses in their
first semester, or students who think they should take no science
courses in their four years of college.  So we have students
meet with their advisors during orientation, to work things out,
and then select and get assigned classes in a relatively short time
frame.

That leads us to the registration process for first-years.

Working closely with their advisor, each student fills out a form that
expresses their plans and hopes for their first semester.  Since there
is limited room in each class (after all, small classes are one of the
hallmarks of a Grinnell education), we've developed a complex but
comparatively fair process for registration.

We do registration in three "rounds".  In the first round, we
randomly order the students and give each student the highest-priority
class that remains in their registration plan for that round.  In
the second round, we reverse the order from the first round and
give each student the highest-priority course that remains in their
list of second-round courses, paying attention to time conflicts.
We do something similar for the third round.  I believe the people
who run the process try to do natural shifting to fit things into
place.

Even in good years, it's an imperfect process.  Students don't
always get the three classes they want.  Some students don't even
get their first choice from the first round [3].  But that should
be okay.  Students should be getting a broad-based education in
their first year and most majors are designed so that you can start
them in your second or third semester.  I teach CS, which has a
fairly long chain of successor courses, and you can start CS as
late as your third semester and still take a semester abroad [4].

This year, the process was even more imperfect than normal.  There
are always a few students for whom the third round is a failure;
either none of the classes they've listed are available or all of
the available ones conflict with their choices from the first two
rounds.  This year, there were over one-hundred students in that
situation.  Worse yet, there were almost no slots available for
them to switch to.  There's a huge difference between "We'll find
another course for you to take from a large set of offerings" and
"Choose one of these five [5] courses".

So our Dean and other administrators scurried to solve the problem.
As I understand it, they chose a two-pronged approach.  First, they
decided to over-enroll most courses open to first-year students by
two or three students [6].  They also found ways to open up a few
additional sections for first-years, presumably by cutting other
courses or convincing a few SFS or part-time faculty to teach more.
Some faculty over-enrolled by even more than that.  For example,
I now have thirty-three students in CSC-151-01 [7], even though the 
course is nominally capped at twenty-four.  I've taught it to as
many as forty-two students, and I should be getting a second class
mentor [8], so the students and I will survive and perhaps even thrive.

But we shouldn't have reached this situation.  So, what went wrong?
I don't know for sure; I'm not anywhere near the inside of the
process.  So I'm just going to draw on my too-many years at Grinnell
and hypothesize.  There are (or were) a lot of factors at play.

_We have a larger-than-normal entering class._  Many students
deferred admission because of the pandemic.  I expect that it didn't
seem quite fair to make it that much harder for students applying
this year to gain admission.  So we have a particularly large
entering class.  You can tell that, in part, because most sections
of Tutorial are at fourteen students rather than twelve [9] and
because we've once again ended up converting some doubles to triples
in the dorms [10].

_We have fewer students than normal studying off campus this semester._
Some students still aren't able to study abroad.  Some study-away programs
have been canceled or postponed.  For example, what looked to be an
awesome ACM [11] Newberry Library Chicago program was canceled.  I also 
expect that many students who could have studied off campus chose not to
because they missed being on campus and seeing their friends.  In any case,
more returning students means fewer slots for incoming students.

_During most of President Kington's tenure, there was a cap on the number
of tenure-line positions._  I've written before about why I thought that
cap damaged the institution.  I argued with President Kington about the
cap, both in public and in private.  I am happy to report that President
Harris has noted that we need to address what she refers to as "deferred
maintenance of the faculty" and has convinced the Trustees to fund more
tenure lines.  But that doesn't help us for this year.

_We may have fewer faculty than normal this year._  I expect that
some faculty members delayed leaves from the pandemic until this
year, particularly those whose research requires them to be elsewhere.
A valued campus leader passed away unexpectedly this summer.  Another
tenured faculty member resigned in the middle of the summer.  There are
likely others who I do not know about.

_No one did the predictive analytics to realize that we'd be in
this situation._  We spent the summer without a Registrar.  Our
previous Registrar left in late spring, before graduation.  Our new
Registrar started in late summer.  I believe our Interim Registrar
returned to the faculty in mid-summer.  And while we have an amazing
set of folks in the Registrar's office [12], they had been incredibly
overworked during the pandemic.  Or maybe they noticed and others
ignored their worries.

Of course, the Open [14] Curriculum makes predictive analytics hard.
Changes in the student body and the world can have significant
effects on what courses students choose.  There was a time when
Introductory Philosophy filled rapidly; I wish it still did.  And,
while Introductory CS has always been close to full, it's only been
the past few years that it's filled so quickly, even as we've added
additional sections.

Unfortunately, I don't think we do any substantive predictive analytics 
for student course demand or, if we do, we don't make significant use
of it.  At least I haven't seen any such information, even when I've
requested or suggested it.  For example, having students enter their 
four-year plans in our academic planning system, rather than on paper,
would give us a broad sense of what students are planning.

_There are philosophical differences about how important it is for
students to get their top choices in their first semester_.  As I
noted earlier, most majors are designed so that students can start
in their first, second, or even third semester.  Hence, most of us
don't consider it essential that students get exactly the courses
they want in their first semester, even though students and their
parents often feel otherwise [15].  I have the most knowledge about
my department, Computer Science.  When I started at Grinnell, the
vast majority of CS majors took their first CS course in their
second semester.  These days, About half of our CS majors take their
first CS course in their second semester.  As importantly, _every
student who tries to register for CSC-151 in their first year gets
CSC-151 in their first year_ [16].  I suppose that we might eventually
reach the level of demand that we can't sustain that guarantee, but
I have always done what I could to achieve that goal.  I think my
colleagues feel similarly.

I must admit that the philosophical differences can run even deeper.
I have heard some campus leaders say that they don't consider it
important for students to get the majors they want.  I believe those
folks are in a small minority, but they do exist and they have had
impacts on some allocation decisions.

_There are philosophical differences in what students should take
in their first semester._  Some students come to Grinnell believing
that they should be able to choose exactly what they want.  But
course selection is a guided discussion, and your advisor can say
no.  For example, I cannot imagine a situation in which I would
allow a first-year student to take three science courses in their
first semester.  When I teach Tutorial (and therefore advise
first-year students), I often make students write essays defending
choices I consider less than ideal, such as students who choose not
to continue or undertake the study of a foreign language.  I will
also note that many faculty (and, fortunately, many students [17])
consider the first semester an ideal time for students to try
something outside of their normal comfort zone.

Hmmm.  I suppose those last two issues had less of an impact on the
insufficient number of slots.  But they did have an impact on
students' (and their parents') feelings that there were insufficiently
many slots in the courses they wanted to take.

So, what should you conclude from all this?

Most importantly, _It's okay if a student doesn't get all the courses
they want in their first semester; they'll get other great courses
and they will generally get the courses they want somewhere during
their time at Grinnell._ I know that it doesn't necessarily feel
that way, and I know that there are exceptions, but in my twenty-plus
years at Grinnell, I've seen most students do perfectly well even
if they don't start with the exact set of courses they wanted.

It's also clear to me that _the pandemic had many direct and indirect 
effects_ (separate from health effects).  It affected the number of
students and faculty on campus.  It likely affected our energy and time
to think carefully about these potential issues.  We are not yet back
to normal.

As that suggests, _this year was the exception, not the rule_.  We
normally have enough sections for first-year students to get a
reasonable set of courses and, as importantly, to shift their
schedule around if they find their initial selection is not quite
right.

But we can do better.  As I noted above, and as I've noted in the past,
_Grinnell needs to do better predictive analytics about course demand
and use those data._  We have a new Registrar.  We may have a new
registration system.  Let's take advantage of the opportunity.

I hope what I've written helps.  I know it helped me to analyze
some of the issues at play.

**Postscript**: From what I can tell, Catherine Ashton, our new Registrar,
was thrust into a very difficult situation and handled that situation with
wisdom and grace.  We are lucky to have hired her.  And, as always, I
appreciate the hard and thoughtful work of the amazing folks at the
Registrar's Office.

Registrar Ashton also dealt well with her first snarky email from SamR.
I appreciate that.  I'd say that I regret sending it, but I learned
things from her response, and so I find that it may have been the right
choice.

**Postscript**: Parents sometimes ask "Why won't a faculty member just
over-enroll a course by one or two students?"  Students sometimes ask
the same question.  But it's rare that only one or two students
want to add a full course.  Where does adding stop?  And how do
we avoid implicit or explicit biases in deciding who to add?  Many of us
find it best to just stick to our predetermined course caps.

---

**Postscript**: Did I promise to discuss how CS deals with its introductory
course?  I think so.  Here goes.

At current staffing levels, counting both tenure-line and term faculty [18],
we can offer five or six sections of CSC-151, Functional Problem Solving,
Grinnell's primary first course in computer science.  CSC-151 is intended
to serve both prospective majors and students who are just taking CS to
expand their ways of thinking.  Almost all students start in CSC-151, even
those with prior CS experience.

Because CSC-151 is a workshop-style class (collaborative, active
learning), we cap the course at twenty-four students.  Six sections
each year permit us to serve 144 students.  We generally offer three
sections in the fall and three sections in the spring.  In part,
that's because it seems to accommodate demand well.  In part, that's
because it works well to balance staffing.

For the fall, we try to leave about 48/72 slots for incoming
first-year students.  We know that that's not enough for the demand.
But we also know that it's fine if students don't take CS their
first semester [19].  In some years, such as this year, all of the
other slots are taken by students entering their third semester.

Both achieving and retaining those 48 slots is hard.  We usually
need to cut returning students to leave that many slots open.  And
we have to hold firm despite the dozens of emails we get asking
to claim one of those slots.  I know that students are unhappy to
be cut.  I know that students are unhappy to be unable to add the
course.  But our staffing only permits so much.

As I noted earlier, first-year students get top priority for the
spring.  We've never had more first-year students interested than
slots available.  Or if we have, we've let them all in.  In most
years, those 72 slots are enough for all interested students, and
we don't have to cut anyone.  But it's always close.  We need all
72 slots.  Sometimes we expand a little so that we don't cut two
or three students.  Sometimes, we have only 70 students.  But it
seems to be the right number, at least at present.  Once in a while,
we have to cut the fourth-years taking the class.

Should we do things differently?  I worry that if we switched to,
say, four sections in the fall and two in the spring, we'd be less
able to serve the students who wanted to take CS after their first
three semesters.  Right now, we seem to be able to serve most such
students [22].  And we also have room for the first-years who have
friends who take CSC-151 in the fall and share their awesome
experiences [23].

I'm not an economist.  I'm not even married to one.  But I expect
there are other factors at play that seem to ensure that the demand
for CSC-151 is fairly close to the supply?

It may matter that students already know that the demand for CSC-151
is comparatively high.  Some students might not even try if they
worry that they are going to get cut [24].  Does it also make a
difference that CSC-151 has a reputation of being a time-consuming
class?  Perhaps that keeps demand lower.  I'm not sure.  Does it
make a difference that CSC-151 is a course that emphasizes computational
thinking, rather than practical programming skills for particular
disciplines?  Again, I'm not sure.  If we had more staffing [25],
we might discuss offering a course that emphasizes practical
programming and how it would fit into the major [27].

Again, I hope that what I've written provides a bit of context to
the choices we make and why there are not enough slots for all interested
students to take CSC-151 in the fall.

---

**_Postscript_**: We did allow an extra fourteen or so students into
CSC-151 this fall.  We'll see how that affects demand in the spring.

---

**_Postscript_**: I've made some claims about what we've always
been able to do or never had to do.  This past spring's registration
(for fall) should probably have taught me to stop making such claims.
As far as I know, we've never before had to cut seniors from required 
courses.  We had to for this semester.  Don't worry, though, they'll
be able to take the courses in the spring.

Did I mention we need more CS faculty?

---

[1] And have expressed some reasonable frustrations.

[2] Plus or minus a year.

[3] I am told that introductory CS fills midway through the first round.
Long-term readers know why we don't provide more slots for first-years
in CS.  I'll probably include some more details later in this musing.

[4] Starting later requires doubling up CS courses, but that's generally
not a problem.

[5] Five is a made-up number.  I don't know the actual count.  I just
know that it was small.

[6] I'd swear I heard "one or two", and the spreadsheet I first received
seems to suggest that, but I see the notes from the faculty meeting say
"two or three", and my chairs heard the same thing.

[7] CSC-151, Functional Problem Solving, is the primary introductory
course in Computer Science, intended for both prospective majors and
for students who just want to learn some CS as part of their broader
education.

[8] No, not a second-class mentor.

[9] I believe that's even after we added at least two extra sections.

[10] That could also be because there was less demand for off-campus housing.

[11] Associated Colleges of the Midwest, not Association of Computing
Machinery.

[12] I seem to recall that we are now supposed to refer to the Registrar's
Office as "EASE".

[14] Individually Advised

[15] As a parent of one college-aged child and two college graduates,
I understand and empathize with the frustration of not having your
child get the courses they want.  But they adapt.

[16] I'm pretty sure that every undeclared student who has pre-enrolled in 
CSC-151 in their third semester has gotten into CSC-151.

[17] At least after they discuss the idea with their faculty member.

[18] If I did not count the term faculty, we would not be able to support
the number of majors we have and would probably be down to three or four
sections of CSC-151.

[19] I realize that there are some counter-arguments.  For example,
some students may rely on CS in their first semester to get a
winter-break internship [20].  Personally, I worry that students
from groups who are underrepresented in the field may take their
failure to get into the course in their first semester as a sign
that they should pursue a different field.  If we had more staffing
[21], perhaps we could try offering more intro sections in the fall.

[20] Those are rare.

[21] Hint, hint.

[22] Well, sometimes not the seniors.

[23] "It may have been my most time-consuming course, and my instructor
made far too many 'jokes', but CS expanded my mind in amazing new ways.
You should take it, too."

[24] As I noted above, I worry about the effects of those from groups
who are underrepresented in the field.

[25] I realize that I'm a bit of a broken record [26] on the staffing
topic.

[26] I was going to explain vinyl records and turntables, but then I
realized that they are hip again and students probably get the idea of
broken records.

[27] That seems like a good topic for a future essay.
