This year, we've seen a significant uptick in the number of students
requesting to take introductory-level CS courses over the summer
so that they can more quickly progress through the CS major.  The
most common requests right now seem to be for courses held at the
University of California, Berkeley [1].  In particular, Berkeley
has a discrete mathematics course [2] that is fairly similar to
Grinnell's MAT/CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_, as well as a data
structures and algorithms course [3] that is fairly similar to
Grinnell's CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Design, Data Structures, and
Algorithms_.  That shouldn't be surprising.  At least in the big
picture, our discrete and data structures courses are fairly standard
[4].

Berkeley also has an SiCP [5,6] course that we have counted as an
equivalent to CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_.  I don't think
anyone has asked to take that this year.

I have mixed feelings about students taking introductory courses
at other
International Students

https://summer.berkeley.edu/international/registration-fees

$570 per unit + $450 registration + $400 international student fee + $63 document management fee.

Domestic students

https://summer.berkeley.edu/application/fees

$570 per unit + $450 registration + $63 document management fee

I had assumed they were online courses.  But they're not.  They're in-person.
That ups the cost significantly.  Or maybe they're not.  61BL permits fully
remote.

[1] Aka "Berkeley" aka "Cal".

[2] Math 55

[3] CS 61B, _Data Structures_

[4] Our discrete is atypical in that it tries to combine the
mathematical with the computational; students write proofs and
programs.  Our data structures is atypical primarily in that we do
not expect that students know the programming language we use in
the course (Java) in advance of the course and that we also cover
some OOP issues, including polymorphism (both subtype and parametric),
inheritance, and encapsulation.  When I teach it, we also make sure
to cover anonymous inner classes and lambdas.

[5] Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.  Named after
[the textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
by Abelson and Sussman and Sussman.  SiCP was once the primary introductory
course at MIT, but is no longer.  Berkeley still offers it.

[6] COMPSCI 61A, _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.
