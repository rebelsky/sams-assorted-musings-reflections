Some time during the past few weeks, a friend wrote to me and asked something like the following.

> Sam, if I recall correctly [1], you have depression. I have a friend with a student with depression. Would you be willing to talk to that student?

I responded as follows.

> Yes, I suffer from (treated) depression. I can try a mentoring conversation, but I'll admit that I find that each person encounters depression differently.

> Feel free to pass my name on.

Last month was National Mental Health Awareness month. So I planned to turn that response into a musing. Or to muse about that response. Or something like that [2]. May was a complicated and busy month, so I never got around to putting down my thoughts in a musing. However, I didn't want to wait another year. So I'm writing something today. It's important to destigmatize mental health issues.

Now that I'm putting my thoughts in order, I note that "I suffer from depression" is probably not the right phrase. "I live with depression" is perhaps more accurate. That is, I have clinical depression. These days, there are also significant situational issues at play [3].

These days, I'm moderately responsible about following the three primary recommendations for treating clinical depression. I take medicine daily. I see my therapist once in a while. What about exercise? I do walk at least thirty minutes a day most days. Does that count?

Talk therapy has been useful, but I don't use it consistently. There are times that talk therapy is more helpful than others. I went through fairly intensive talk therapy during the pandemic, particularly at the time leading up to my heart attack. It's helped. It may have helped other aspects of my personality more than my depression; the toolbox I built with my therapist has certainly kept my anger in check. I'm not sure how closely the anger and the depression relate.

Hmmm ... perhaps we should take a step backward and restart in a different place.

Hi. My name is Sam. I live with depression. Every day, I find myself challenged to put together enough energy to get things done. Getting out of but can also be challenging. I feel hopeless. And I'm frustrated that it's so damn difficult to describe how the fog of depression impacts my ability to get things done.

I don't think most people know that I'm a person with depression. I present a happy, cheerful demeanor. Or sometimes an angry demeanor. Although I say "demeanor", the feelings are usually real. When I'm in class, teaching, or in a meeting, aruing, I'm often happy and energized. But when things quiet down and by myself, which happens quite often, the mood usually shifts. And those quiet times are when I need to get things done at home or at work or in my life.

For most of my life, my situation has not been one that should lead to depression. I have an awesome wife who I love deeply and who loves me back. I have three amazing children. I have a rewarding job which allows me to make a positive difference in the world. I'm compensated well for that job.

However, as I said, I have clinical depression. It's a complicated chemical reaction, not under my control. And it makes it hard to get things done.

Fortunately, I also have a relatively strong sense of obligation. I get out of bed in the morning so that I can get to work and teach my classes. Often (but perhaps not enough), when I just want to curl up and do nothing, I can convince myself that I need to get work done for my students or my colleagues or my family [4]. That sense of obligation keeps me going forward. The meds, the therapy, and the occasional exercise just help.

Now that you have some of the background, we can return to the opening topic of this musing.

I never met with the student. I hope that they found better resources. I'm still not sure what I would have said to them. I might have tried one or more of the following.

Depression is a disease. Just as you'd consider it reasonable to ask for help and for accommodations if you had a broken ankle (or something more permanent, like a fused ankle), you should ask for help with and accommodations for your depression. 

Unfortunately, not everyone will understand that depression is a diseaase that needs accommodations. Rely on your allies in the Disability Resources Office for help.

People with depression can have successful (and even happy) lives. I hope that I serve as an example of that [5].

Depression is a disease. It's a disease that needs treatment. Most people with depression find that the triumverate of medicine, talk therapy, and exercise helps treat the depression.

Unfortunately, not everyone can afford talk therapy. Remember that there are often other options for talk therapy. Perhaps a religious leader (priest, rabbi, imam, etc.) can serve that role. Perhaps your institution provides options.

Not everyone encounters depression the same way. Don't assume that what works for one person will work for you. And don't give up when what works for one person doesn't work for you. Try something else.

You will encounter far too many people who don't understand the difference between colloquial depression ("I'm depressed because ...") and clinical depression ("I live with depression"). There are resources out there that help explain the difference [6]. Or you can explain it yourself. "Depression is a disease. It's caused by the chemistry of the body, not situations. However, situations can make it worse." Something like that, in your own words.

I don't know you much, but I'd lay odds that there are people who care deeply about you. As hopefuless as things may seem at times, try to remember that succumbin to the worst of your depression will hurt these people. Get help!

And, as I've implied before, _talk to disability resources_.

[1] It appears my memory was not precise. They wrote "iirc".


[2] Has "I planned to do X. Or Y. Or something like that" become too much of a common trope in my writing?

[3] At the Reunion Picnic last night, I struggled to talk to people about what's going on in my life.

[4] Those are in the wrong order. However, I find it easier to say "My job requires me to do X" than "My life requires me to do X".

[5] I assume that's why my friend wanted me to talk to the student.

[6] I'm too lazy to look them up. But your Disability Resources office can help.
