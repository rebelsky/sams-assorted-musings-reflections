title: Another (not-quite) triennial salary review
number: 1168
tags: [Salary reviews](index-salary-reviews), long, things I had to write
blurb: This one is quadrennial!

It's time, once again, for my [triennial salary
review](triennial-salary-reviews) [1]. Michelle asks me why I bother
spending more than minimal effort filling out the forms and writing
the essays. The last few years suggest that she is right. After the
necessary zero percent raise in 2020, I got a raise that was both
below the Cost-of-Living Adjustment and below the average Grinnell
raise in 2021, in spite of having a merit score of 4.5 out of 5 and
in spite of the College's endowment growing substantially.  Of
course, almost everyone at Grinnell got a below-COLA increase, so
perhaps I shouldn't complain [2].

Arguably, filling out the form and writing the essays is an opportunity
to reflect on the past few years and to look ahead. But these were
not a great few years; I'm not sure that I want to look back. And
the thing I'm most looking forward to is senior faculty status.

Still, I want to make sure that my CV is up to date, and I'd prefer
not to be penalized for failing to do this required task. So here
goes.

I suppose I should warn you that this exercise is likely to frustrate
me.  You knew that, didn't you?  Oh well. I'll see you again after
the essays and their commentaries.

---

Surprisingly, we are not asked to provide an opening context
statement. Perhaps it's not surprising. Perhaps it's a reminder
that too few of our processes admit a broader context.

So what is the first question?  Here goes?

**If you believe there are end-of-course evaluation results that need to be clarified, please explain.**

I wasn't expecting to have to respond to this question. My end-of-course-evaluation (EOCE) scores are generally high. Most students learn a lot from me and appreciate the way I teach, despite my many flaws (lack of organization and belated grading being foremost among them). But ratings for the Fall 2017 sections of CSC-301, Analysis of Algorithms, and the CSC-321/322 software design conglomerate were surprisingly low.  That is, while I usually have at least 90% of my students agree or strongly agree to the statements "The instructor helped me to understand the subject matter" and "I learned a lot in this course", my 300-level courses were mostly at about 60%.

Then I looked a bit closer at the broader context. My explanation follows.

> I had forgotten that my EOCEs in my 300-level courses in 2017--18 were low, but it appears they were.  Because of understaffing in the department, I was teaching a 4.5-course load in Fall 2017 (CSC-321 and CSC-322 together met for six hours per week; after the courses were passed on to other faculty the teaching credit moved from 1.0 to 1.5), and most of my courses were over-enrolled (321 and 322 were supposed to be capped at 20, if I recall correctly, and enrolled approximately 30; CSC-151 already had a high cap at 32, and I was teaching two sections of 33 and 37).  I was also advising an inordinate number of students (57 in Fall 2017).  If I recall the data we received at the time correctly, no one in the prior decade had advised more than forty.  Given that workload, I find it unsurprising that some of my ratings were low. 

Should I go back and look at the End of Course Evaluations for more details?  Nah. It's not worth my time.

Why did I teach such an overload?  Because I cared (and still care) for our students and our curriculum.  However, if the past year has taught me anything, it's that I can no longer make such sacrifices.

---

The next question up is the most important.

**In 1-2 paragraphs describe your most significant teaching, athletic coaching, or library instructional accomplishment(s) during this review period. If possible, phrase your discussion in terms of impact on students and/or campus learning community.**

I always find it hard to fit my answer in the two paragraphs
permitted. Oh well. Here goes.

> The most important change I made to my teaching over the past few
years was a move to mastery grading, a variant of specifications
grading, in CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_.  It is a change
I made following the lead of my colleague, Peter-Michael Osera. In
this model, we assess students on whether they have achieved the
core components of the course and whether they can apply them in
new contexts. Both are tied directly to the learning goals of the
course. Small problems allow us to check student mastery of the
learning goals; larger assignments allow us to see how they apply
them.  By allowing students to re-do or replace anything that does
not meet the specifications, we grade students on the knowledge
that they demonstrate by the end of the term, rather than the time
at which they demonstrate it.  At the end of the semester, I can
confidently state that the students have earned the grades they
have and can demonstrate the reasons why to others.  The model
encourages a growth mindset in students, helping them understand
that even if they don't master something quickly, we have confidence
that they can master it later.  This model is particularly important
for CSC-151 because students come from a wide variety of backgrounds,
with some having had many more opportunities to pick up computing
concepts before College.  It does, however, require extra effort
to write problems and make-up problems and to give students feedback
that lets them improve their larger application assignments.  I
wrote approximately ninety separate problems for the Fall-2 2020
section of CSC-151 and wrote or rewrote almost ninety more for the
Spring-1 2021 section, problems that my colleague, Nicole Eikmeier
was able to use "as is" in the Spring-2 section.

> During this time frame, I also developed a new version of CSC-151
that focuses on the Digital Humanities, which included developing
a dozen or more new laboratories (as well as corresponding assignments
and code libraries) and reworking about twenty or so more.  The
Digital Humanities focus permits us to explore computing from a
different perspective and, we hope, makes it attractive to a different
group of students.  I taught CSC/PSY/TEC-232, _Human-Computer
Interaction_ for the first time.  I also taught a new Tutorial
focusing on Grinnell's approach to liberal education.  I had hoped
to tie to the fiftieth anniversary of Tutorial and the Individually
Advised Curriculum; unfortunately, planning for those anniversaries
appears to have been lost in the pandemic.  Finally, like all
faculty, I had the difficulty of converting fourteen-week semester-long
courses to seven-week, term-long courses.  Since most of my classes
are workshop-style courses with planned activities, that conversion
was particularly difficult.

Whoo!  Two paragraphs.  I'm impressed with myself at staying within
limits.  I hope that you are, too [3].

---

We follow the prior question with one that is almost as important.

**In one to two paragraphs provide your teaching, athletic coaching, or library instructional goals for the next review period.**

Can I make snarky comments about the switch from "1-2" [4] to "one to two"?
Nah.  "A foolish consistency" and all that [5].

> My primary teaching goal for the next review period is to incorporate
mastery grading and/or specifications grading in all of my courses.  Having
seen the power of that style of grading, particularly in encouraging students
to continue to try, and how it adjusts to the events that regularly
happen in students' lives, I would like to use it uniformly.  I am
working on doing so in CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_, although
I must admit that it is more challenging in an upper-division course.

> We had a long-standing image-based version of CSC-151, _Functional
Problem Solving_ that focused on image making, relying on the GNU
Image-Manipulation Program for the image-making infrastructure; we
moved away from it because the infrastructure was fragile.  Having
seen students' enthusiasm for the portions of CSC-151 that focus
on image making, whether in the Data Science offering or the Digital
Humanities offering, I see power in the centrality of images.
Nationwide, image-making has also shown to be a topic for introductory
CS that helps encourage those traditionally underrepresented in the
field to both try the course and to persist.  During the next review
period, I hope to develop a new image-based version of CSC-151, one
without the GNU Image Manipulation Program.  I may also collaborate with
Peter-Michael Osera on an audio version of the course.  In both cases,
I expect to consider ways we can keep the course accessible.

I kept it to two paragraphs again.  Yay me!  I'm also keeping my
ambitions in check.  Are there other things I'd like to do?  I'd
like to teach CSC-207 again.  I'd like to teach CSC-301 again.  At
some point, I'd like to think about making "Computing for Social
Good" the focus of one of our courses.  Maybe CSC-151.  Maybe
CSC-207.  But there's only so much time.  A year ago, I would have
told you that I planned to teach a course on computing ethics.  Again,
there's only so much time.  I'll leave that to other members of
the department.

---

Next up are three questions that don't apply to me.  I include them
here for the sake of completeness [6].

**If your contract includes significant professional responsibilities instead of a 5-course teaching load, please provide this information. Note that details of the position are not required.**

**In 1-2 paragraphs describe your most significant accomplishments in this role during the review period. If possible, phrase your discussion in terms of specific impact on the college community or advancement of the college mission.**

**If applicable, in one to two paragraphs provide goals for the next review period that are related to this professional responsibility.**

---

And then we move on to scholarship.

**In one to two paragraphs, discuss the impact of your scholarship. In the case of multi-authored scholarship, describe your contribution.**

> A paper with Janet Davis, "Developing soft and technical skills
through multi-semester, remotely-mentored, community-based service
projects", won an outstanding paper award at the 50th Annual SIGCSE
Technical Symposium, designated second best in the "experience
reports" track (out of 526 papers submitted to three different
tracks).  That paper reports work that Janet initiated and that I
continued.  I wrote the first draft of the paper, Janet then revised
it significantly, and we both polished it.  SIGCSE Technical Symposium
papers are reviewed in an anonymous form and become part of the
archival literature for the discipline.

> My primary work over these past few years has been on investigating
the efficacy of non-traditional approaches to teaching computer
science on middle-school students' interest and self-efficacy in
computing.  That has involved working with research students on
developing curricula and conducting week-long summer "code camps",
relying on topics like crafts, data science for social good, and
digital humanities.  We published two papers and presented a few 
talks and posters on this area during the review period.

Hmmm.  I haven't mentioned my other collaboratively authored work,
which is mostly Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, panels, and the like.
Oh well.  I'm sticking to two paragraphs.

---

There's also the "looking ahead" portion.

**In one to two paragraphs provide your scholarly goals for the next review period.**

For the non-traditional-paths project to continue, we would need
to move to a much bigger scope, a scope that is likely beyond one
that will work in rural Iowa.  It would require broader collaborations,
some grants, a lot more of those 60-hour summer weeks.  I'm not up to 
that task.  So I'm thinking smaller.

> For the next review period, I will be continuing an earlier
project, the Mathematical Image Synthesis Toolkit (MIST), which
provides a novel approach to the computational construction of
non-representational interactive images and animations.  The
project involves theory (how we conceptualize images and animations),
implementation (the image-making software), and user studies
(how others make images with the software).  I hope to produce a
small text to promote the underlying theory of the project along
with a public release of the software.

---

Finally, we move on to service.

**If any of the committees you served on during the review period did anything unusually time-consuming for that committee, please describe it. You can assume that the Faculty Salary Committee is aware of the normal duties of each committee.**

It's fascinating that they don't ask us to describe our broader
kinds of service, and that they assume that the service is all
internal.  I wish someone would review the relationship between the
rubric and the forms.

**Briefly describe any service activities that are not reflected elsewhere. This can include recruiting, informal committees, and substantial departmental or institutional service. Please note approximate time commitment per month.**

Hmmm.  No paragraph limits this time.  That's probably a bad idea
when they have to deal with people like me.  And I suppose that I
should have read this in advance of starting to write my service
report; I assumed it would be another "Describe your service
accomplishments in one paragraph of less" type of prompt.  Oh well.
I'd only drafted the Department Chair portion of it.  Now I can
write the rest.

> In the past four years, I served the department, the College, and
my discipline in a variety of ways.  Among other things, (a) I
served as department chair for one year; (b) I served as back-up
department chair for three years; (c) I performed my usual range
of department service; (d) I performed my usual range of institutional
service; (e) I performed my usual range of disciplinary service;
(f) I served leadership roles for two professional organizations;
(g) I served leadership roles for four major conferences in
CS education; and (h) I served leadership roles for three major
diversity in CS conferences

> a\. I served as Department Chair in 2020--2021, one of the most
complex years of the department.  We remained significantly
understaffed, with by far the highest ratio of majors to regular
faculty in the college (approximately 17:1 with 60 majors per class
year, six tenure-line faculty, and one permanent senior lecturer).
Chairing the department during a pandemic involved a host of
adjustments as well as running interference for my faculty.  I also
had to represent the department as ITS repeatedly instituted new
policies without considering the impact on a department that creates
software as part of its curriculum.  <!-- "You can't recommend software
to students." "You can't use the software you write."  "You can't
distribute the software you write to people outside the College."
"If you use unapproved software, we will terminate you."  I had to
repeatedly explain why these policies, and others like them, made
it nearly impossible for us to run our curriculum and conduct
our research.  ITS also regularly questioned the expertise of the
female CS faculty, enough so that one will no longer teach our
software design course.  I'm not sure why I, rather than the Dean's
office, had to follow up on ITS's decision to inappropriately charge
a female faculty member's startup funds without telling them. -->  I
also wrote the response to our external review, drafted a departmental
policies and procedures document called for by that review, redeveloped
the Department's Web site after ITS took the old one down and failed
to make a complete backup, attempted to keep that site up to date,
chaired an interim review, and chaired a search.  And then there
were the normal departmental chair responsibilities, responsibilities
that are high enough for our understaffed department that it is
taking two faculty members to do them this year (along with three
others who are running the five faculty reviews this year), and
they are still significantly behind.  I suppose that it's no surprise
that that level of workload contributed to my heart attack.  I did not
keep close track of the time, but it was generally 10--20 hours per
week, about 50--90 hours per month.

> b\. 2017--2020 were Jerod Weinman's first three years as Department
Chair.  Jerod regularly turned to me for advice, support, and, on
occasion, a bit of extra work.  Among other things, I was asked to
help coordinate a variety of department events.  In Spring 2020,
Dean Harris asked me to return from leave to support the department
during the chaos of the transition to online learning, particularly
with regards to some student concerns raised in that transition.
The "backup chair" work took approximately ten hours per month,
on average.

> c\. I don't tend to keep track of the extra work I do in the
department; it's part of the job.  Perhaps my Review Chair will 
be able to suggest a few things of particular import.  From my
perspective, the work I do to support diversity and inclusion in
the department is the most important of such work; I discuss that
in the diversity statement.  Ignoring hiring and reviews, department
work is generally about five hours per week when I'm not chairing.

> d\. I have nothing specific to add.

> e\. Like most professionals at my stage, I serve the discipline
in many ways.  I review papers for conferences.  I participate in
grant review panels for the National Science Foundation (three or
four last spring alone).  I review scholarship applications for
conferences that focus on diversity.  I review departments.  I
participate in the AP CSP Principles reading.  I've done all of
that during this review period.  I even got to do my first remote
department review and my first online readings.  It's hard to come
up with a monthly average.  Reviews of scholarship applications are
perhaps between four and eight hours of work.  Grant review panels
are typically scheduled for two-and-a-half days and require an
additional two-and-a-half days of reading in preparation for the
meeting.  Department reviews are generally a day of preparation,
two or three days at the institution, and a day afterward working
on the report.  The AP reading is about 60 hours when I'm a table
leader and 30--40 hours when I'm a remote reader.

> f\. During the review period, I served as Vice-Chair for the
Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on
Computers and Society (ACM SIGCAS) and as the primary mailing list
moderator for the Association of Computing Machinery's Special
Interest Group on Computer Science Education (ACM SIGCSE).  SIGCAS
took about an hour per week, although I also had a few weekend-long
meetings to attend.  As moderator, I spent about two to three hours
each week moderating messages, responding to email, managing
memberships, and working on longer-term plans.

> g\. I served as an Associate Program Chair (APC) for the ACM
SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education in all
four years of the review period.  As an APC, I am responsible for
coordinating discussion amongst reviewers, encouraging reviewers
to provide more/better feedback to authors, and summarizing the
reviews, usually for eight or nine papers.  In this period, I was
also asked to provide some sample APC materials for SIGCSE to share
with newer APCs.  Each year, serving as APC takes between 20 and
40 hours.  I also served as one of the Student Volunteers Chairs
for the 2018 and 2019 ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposia.  In that role,
I was responsible for maintaining and updating the software used to
assign volunteers, attracting and managing the volunteers, assigning
volunteers to shifts, and such.  The first year took me
about 100 hours before the conference and about 40 hours at the
conference.  The second year took 70 or so before the conference and
about 40 at the conference.

> h\. Details about my service to the ACM/CMD-IT Richard Tapia
Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference can be found in
my statement of contributions to diversity.  Serving as Scholarships
Chair took about 40--60 hours of work for Tapia 2019 and a similar
amount for Tapia 2020.  I also spent about 20 hours as an unofficial
help desk coordinator for Tapia 2020.  Since spring 2021, I've spent
about ten hours per week as part of the Tapia 2021 Infrastructure
Committee.

Are those times right?  I'm not sure.  But we were told to approximate.
And I don't log my life [7].  But, um, I do seem to spend a lot of
time on service.  Fortunately, most of it is valuable.  At least I
think it's valuable.

As you can tell, I was not all that brief.  However, I do a lot of service.
I think I was appropriately brief in each description.  Does it matter
that I wasn't brief, other than that the Salary Committee has more to read?
Unfortunately, Interfolio wouldn't let me enter it all in the field on the 
form; it appears I exceeded the hidden limit for "brief".  Fortunately,
moving the rant about being Chair to the prior section solved the problem.

Sadly, there's no "looking ahead" paragraph for service.  I had
hoped to write one.  I guess nothing prevents me from doing so, if
only for you.

> I anticipate focusing most of my service efforts on issues related
to broadening participation in computing, primarily through my service
to CMD-IT (the Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities
in IT) and the ACM/CMD-IT Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity
in Computing Conference.  I will also continue to serve SIGCSE in
whatever ways seem most appropriate.  (This year, I am serving as
one of the Evaluations Chairs.)  

> I hope to never again serve as Department Chair.

Whoops.  That's two paragraphs.  But one paragraph is short and the
other is a one-sentence paragraph.  We'll count it as one paragraph with
a strange blank line in the middle.

---

Teaching. Scholarship. Service.  The big three [9].  Are we done yet?
Nope!  There's an optional question.

**If the above have missed any significant activities during the review period, you may describe them here.**

Was there anything else significant?  Nope, I don't think so. Oh,
wait!  I took Ralph's class on creative nonfiction.  That was quite
significant to me [10].  It's probably not significant to the Faculty
Salary Committee.

Speaking of writing, "have missed" feels wrong to me, even if
Grammarly doesn't critique.  Perhaps just "missed".  Or "If _you_
have missed".  Or "If _your responses above_ have missed".  Or
perhaps even a broader rewrite.

> **Here you may describe any other significant activities during the
  review period.**

We're still not done.  There's room for optional statements!  However,
they are not on the main form, so it will take a moment for me to look
them up.  Let's see ... there are two statements.  I've still not received
an answer as to how the Faculty Salary Committee will use them.  Oh well,
I'm still going to think about them.

Let's give each its own section.

---

**Statement of Contributions to Diversity**

**_Describe activities that support diversity on campus, such as mentoring and advising faculty or students, special recruitment efforts, submitting grants or proposals, or involvement in co-curricular programs._**

I'm interested to see that they only seem to care about diversity on campus.  I'm interested in broader issues of diversity.  And, after reading [a recent piece by John McWhorter](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/opinion/language-race-semantics.html), I also find myself wondering whether we are employing our historically broad interpretation of diversity or a much narrower one.  Oh well, let's just see what comes out when I write freely.

> For much of my career, diversifying the group of people who "do"
computer science has been a top priority.  I've done so by employing
curricular strategies shown to accommodate a broader variety of
people (e.g., active learning, choosing course themes that expand
ideas of what computing can be), by encouraging students from groups
underrepresented in computing, and by acknowledging the broader
problems in computing.  My work is acknowledged in the recent
CS department external review.

> > One key place in which enrollment pressures negatively impact
faculty workload is in outreach, retention, and inclusion initiatives.
While all three of these areas are foundational priorities for the
department, and while all faculty contribute to these initiatives,
one faculty member (Sam Rebelsky) takes on the lion’s share of the
workload. Faculty, staff, administrators, and students within and
outside the Computer Science department unanimously pointed out
Sam’s outsize contributions in these areas[.] (p. 4)

> Much of my effort has gone toward finding ways to support student
travel to both the ACM/CMD-IT Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity
in Computing Conference ("Tapia"), the Grace Hopper Celebration of
Women in Computing ("GHC"), and the Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and
Kansas Regional Celebration of Women in Computing ("MINK-WIC").  I
fundraise from alumni.  I encourage students to apply for scholarships.
I look for pockets of money on campus that might help students
attend.  I run the department scholarship program using the funds
I obtain.  I help prepare students for the conferences.
For MINK-WIC, I drive them to the conference.  When I attend the
conferences, I support them while at the conferences.  Why do I
focus on these areas?  Because I regularly hear from students that
attending the conferences has an outsize impact not only on their
willingness to persist in computing but also on their enthusiasm
for helping others.  This year, Nicole Eikmeier has graciously taken
on many of the responsibilities for Hopper.

> Last year, I applied for a small grant from the STARS Ignite Program
to support students attending Tapia in 2022.  Affiliating with STARS
has also meant that our students could participate in STARS activities
at Tapia 2021.

> Beyond CS, I served as a Grinnell Science Project (GSP) co-director 
for the Fall 2017 GSP cohort.

> However, I believe my responsibility to broaden participation in
computing goes beyond Grinnell.  These days, I do most of my work
by participating in accessibility communities and emphasizing
accessibility in the SIGCSE community, and by my leadership roles
associated with the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in
Computing.

> After many years of reviewing student scholarship applications
for the ACM/CMD-IT Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing
Conference (as well as for the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women
in Computing), I was invited to serve as one of the Scholarship
Chairs for Tapia 2019 and again for Tapia 2020.  For Tapia 2020,
which unexpectedly moved online, I ended up being the unofficial
"Help Desk Manager".  My success in that position led the conference
to create a new position of "Outreach Coordinator" for me for Tapia
2021 and to invite me to the conference Infrastructure Committee
(the General Chair, the Program Chair, the Deputy Chair, the
Accessibility Chairs, the lead CMD-IT staff, and me).  During spring
and summer 2021, I participated in weekly meetings and did related
work.  I hope to continue serving Tapia in the years to come.

Damn.  That simultaneously feels like too much and not enough.  Do
I want to dig out the Program Chair's comments on why she wanted me
as "Outreach Coordinator" and such?  Nah.  Am I tooting my own horn
a bit too much?  Perhaps.  Okay, maybe it's the right amount.

---

On to the final section.  Can you guess what it is?

**Statement of Contributions to Student Research**

This one doesn't even have instructions.

I asked how the Faculty Salary Committee was going to use this and the
prior statement.  I didn't get a clear response.  Mostly it's just "We
asked this in Sedona, so we're asking it in Interfolio."  As I noted
earlier, I expect that contributions to diversity (broadly defined, I
hope) will eventually become part of our salary rubric.  But this?  As far
as I know, contributions to student research relate much more to our
ability to take year-long sabbaticals [11].  They have little to do
with [our salary rubric](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Fac_Resources/Faculty_Salary_Criteria.pdf), other than that supporting MAPs counts.
However, the Salary Committee can take MAP info directly from the list
of courses they receive.  So why write this?  Maybe so that I have it
in place for the next (potentially last) sabbatical application.

> I have done my best to provide students with opportunities to
engage in research and research-like opportunities, both in my
courses and in summer MAPs and independents.  In CSC-301, I include
a component in which students read and implement an algorithm from
the primary literature.  This year, I hope to make it an algorithm
with implications about implicit bias.  CSC-321 and CSC-322 (now
CSC-324 and CSC-326) include a significant project component.  And
the new (to me) CSC/PSY/TEC-232 provides students with experience
in most stages of a user study.

> I continue to believe that full-time summer work is the best
experience for all students, particularly students from groups
underrepresented in the field and students who lack confidence in
their abilities.  Hence, I have traditionally tried to provide as
many summer opportunities as I can.  However, I have received many
signs that others feel differently and that this model has fallen
out of favor.  I do not know what this means for the future, and
I hope that this year and next will bring added clarity.

Isn't that a positive ending note?  But it's true.  The only people
who seem to think it's a good idea that I take lots of students are
the students themselves and a selected set of colleagues. But those
in power?  Nope.  And I'm sick of fighting about it [15].

---

Did you enjoy reading all of that?  I didn't particularly enjoy
writing it. My goal for this year was to worry less and to be less
frustrated.  But it's hard to do so while writing about multiple
years that involve not only persistent lack of support but also
regular micro and macroaggressions. Oh well. Let's pretend that it
was cathartic to write everything.  In truth, only a few parts made
me angry.  And I suppose there was some catharsis in getting some
of it out.  Perhaps I'll add one more complaint.

> When we discussed the prioritization of risk management in ITS
policies, and I mentioned that there were other risks, such as risks
to people, I never imagined that I was talking about myself, at
least not in the way it turned out.

Yeah, that does feel better.  Perhaps I'll even avoid sending that
directly to someone.

Is anything left?  Always.  I'll muse about the joys of Interfolio
separately.  That reminds me.  I need to make sure that I get all
of my activities entered in Interfolio.  Joy.

There's also one final question.  Should I request a meeting with
the Dean after I get my review?  The used to be the norm before
Mike arrived.  Then it became the responsibility of the Director
of the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment.  But the CTLA
Director is not our supervisor.  The Dean is.  Don't you want your
supervisor to know about you?  Doesn't your supervisor want to know
about the faculty?  But what would my review tell our Dean?  Mostly
that I'm a curmudgeon.  They'll hear that from other sources.

---

**Postscript**: The last time I did this, I went through
[the salary rubric](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Fac_Resources/Faculty_Salary_Criteria.pdf) and tried to assign a score to myself.  I suppose
it wouldn't hurt to do so again.  Let's see.

For teaching, I have some low scores.  But I think they are
explainable.  I definitely hit "B. Advising an especially large
number of students per semester, during the semesters in which the
faculty member taught".  Hey, I even hit it during semesters in
which I was on leave [17].  "C. Teaching classes outside of core
competencies, especially service courses like tutorial and statistics."
Check.  I taught Tutorial.  Potentially, HCI counts here, too.  "D.
Teaching independent studies, guided readings, for-credit internships,
and Mentored Advanced Projects (MAPs)."  Check.  But doesn't everyone?
"E. Teaching courses that may diversify the curriculum and/or courses
that are distinctive in their innovative character. Such courses
may include but are not limited to digital liberal arts, community-based
learning, or course[-]embedded travel."  I developed a new Digital Humanities
CSC-151.  CSC-321 and CSC-322 involve community-based learning.  Should I
go back and make that explicit in my statement?  Nah.  I'll leave it to
my Review Chair.

I can't get a 5.  I don't have high outliers [18].  Perhaps a 4.
"Good peer evaluations, self-description of teaching as it appears
in the Faculty Activities Report and 2 or more additional factors
that the College values."  I have at least four additional factors
that the College values.

On to scholarship.  Again, I don't think I deserve a 5.  My work is
not seminal [19].  But it did get an award.  If I count correctly,
I published four refereed, anonymously reviewed [19], conference papers,
one of which got an award.  There were some posters, panels, and BoFs.
I'd hope that's enough for a 4.

And then there's service.  I do a lot of service.  I'd like to say
I deserve a 5.  But the criteria suggest otherwise.  "The evidence
shows that the candidate discharged the duties of a demanding elected
or appointed office within the institution in an outstanding and
highly effective manner or in some cases multiple level 4 activities."
I suppose we could say that I did that as Chair, but it was only
for one year.  It would be insulting to say that I deserve less
than a 4 for service.

Hmmmm .... 4 for teaching.  4 for scholarship.  4 for service.  It
appears that I'm uniform.  What if the Faculty Salary Committee is
feeling generous, or my Review Chair is particularly persuasive,
and I earn a 5 for service?  Let's see ... .45 x 4 + .25 x 4 + .3
x 5 = 4.30.  That rounds up to a 4.5.  I wonder if that's what
happened last time?  As I said, I'm fairly uniform in both what I
do and how I do it.

Either a 4 or a 4.5 seems reasonable.  I've done a lot in the
period, and a lot well, but I have room for growth.

I just wish we had combat pay.

**Postscript**: This plus the CV plus the Interfolio garbage
represents more than nine hours of work [20].  Another day of my life
down the drain.  Michelle's right.  It's probably not worth the
effort.

**Postscript**: After spending three hours fighting with Interfolio
[21], I decided to add one more thing to that final open-ended
section.  Here goes.

> I believe I have covered everything in the comments above and in
my CV.  After too much time fighting with Interfolio, I cannot be
sure that the data there are complete or completely correct.  But
it's not worth either my time or yours for me to make things perfect.
You should get enough of a sense of my value to the College, or
lack thereof, from the comments and the CV.

[1] It was scheduled for last year but delayed by the pandemic.  Hence,
this is arguably a "quadrennial" salary review.

[2] Or perhaps we should all complain.  It's not pleasant to feel
undervalued by the institution.  More precisely, our institution
should not undervalue us.

[3] That is, I hope that you're either impressed with yourself or
impressed with me.

[4] Agh!  It's a hyphen, not an en-dash!

[5] Emerson's "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" is
one of the phrases I live by.

[6] Or for completeness' sake.

[7] There was a time that I logged my life.  I don't do so any more.

[8] Someday soon, there will likely be a fourth: IDEA (Inclusion,
Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility) [9].

[9] I don't recall where or with whom I was discussing this acronym.
The government added "Accessibility" at the end of "DEI".  I like rearranging
the letters for a better acronym.  (At least no one used "DIE".)  "AIDE"
is also not bad.

[10] It may be difficult to tell from this musing, but _The Craft of
Creative Nonfiction_ significantly affected how I approach and reflect
on my writing.

[11] In order to qualify for a full-year sabbatical, a faculty member
must contribute at an appropriate level to our "opportunities for all
interested students to do research" program [12].

[12] Feel free to insert your own snarky note about the disconnect
between the College's supposed commitment to this program and its
failure to provide enough CS faculty to support such opportunities
for CS majors.  Or you could ask me to write the long rant on what's
happened with the research opportunities program [14].

[14] The last conversation I've had about it suggested that it's more
about providing opportunities in courses, rather than the full-semester
(and preferably full-summer) opportunities that are more impactful.  But
if it's focused on opportunities in 300-level courses, what happens to
the faculty who don't teach 300-level courses.  As I said, I could rant
and ramble bout many problematic aspects of the program.

[15] That brings up the latest challenge for Sam's attempt to pull
back.  We've been told we can no longer take volunteer summer research
students [16].  I don't agree with all of the rationales, but I accept
many of them.  What's the challenge?  Will I be able to avoid asking
the obvious questions?

> "Since we can no longer take volunteers, is the College going to
increase the number of summer students it will support for each
faculty member?"

> "Since student equity is an issue, are we planning to increase
the stipend for summer research students to match national norms, or 
at least to match current pay scales at Grinnell?"

Now that I've written them down, I think I can avoid asking them at
the next meeting in which this comes up.  At least I hope I can.

[16] I debated about the hyphen in "summer research".  What are
"summer research students"?  Are the students who are doing summer
research, which would suggest the hyphen?  Are they research students
during the summer, which would suggest avoiding the hyphen?  Or is
"summer research" a common enough phrase that the hyphen is
unnecessary?  The whole matter complicated by the addition of the
adjective "volunteer".  I suppose I could write "volunteer, summer,
research students".  Perhaps one of my more grammatically informed
sons, students, or colleagues will enlighten me.

[17] Never again.  That is, I will not permit a significant overload
of advisees while on leave.  Perhaps I should say that I'll take none
while on leave.  I wonder how the College would adjust to that?

[18] I'm still waiting to hear how they are determining outliers.  It's
a reasonable question.  There aren't all that many statistical tests.

[19] "Blind review" is an inappropriate term.  Here's [a nice
explanation as to
why](https://blog.apaonline.org/2020/02/20/an-end-to-blind-review/).  Don't
use it.  Complain when you see Interfolio (and others) use it.

[20] Once I finished with Interfolio, it was closer to eleven.

[21] As I noted, we'll see more about that in a future musing.
