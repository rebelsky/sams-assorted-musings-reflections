From _Love and Knishes_.

* 8 cups flour
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 cakes fresh yeast (I can't find this anymore, so I always look up the alternatives)
* 2 cups lukewarm potato water (water in which peeled potatoes have been cooked)
* 1/4 cup salad oil
* 4 eggs, slightly beaten
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 quarts boiling water
* poppy seed or sesame seed (optional)

Sift together dry ingredients into a large mixing boxl. Soften yeast in one third of the potato water. Add to the flour. Add oil to the remaining potato water and stir into the flour mixture. Add eggs and stir briskly to form a ball of dough.

Knead on a lightly floured board for ten minutes. This must be a firm dough; add more flour if necessary. Return to the bowl, smooth side up. Cover with a tea towel and let rise at room temperature until the dough rises to the top of the bowl. Knead again on a lightly floured board until smooth and eleastic (as for rolls). Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between the palms to form ropes about 6 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Pinch the ends together firmly to make a doughnut shape.

Add sugar to boiling water. Drop bagels into the water one at a time. As they come to the surface, turn them over. Boil 1 minute longer on the second side. Please on a greased cooky sheet and bake at 450 degrees until the crust is golden brown and crisp (10 to 15 minutes). Bagels may be sprinkled with poppy seed or sesame seed before baking, if desired. Makes about 30.
