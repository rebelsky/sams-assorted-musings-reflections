**Trigger warning: Hate speech**

I self-identify as Jewish.  More precisely, I self-identify as
culturally Jewish.  Perhaps even East-coast culturally Jewish.  That
may not be surprising; I was raised by two East-coast non-religious
Jews.  My parents didn't practice when both were alive.  I'm not
sure if my father ever practiced; after all, he was raised in a
commune.

We did spend some of the high holidays at friends' houses [1], but
we never had our own Seder.  The most religious celebration in our
house was either Ground-Hog's day (an excuse to invite friends over
for a communal brunch) or the party that mom referred to as "Christians
decorate the tree, Jews eat and drink, pick your religion for the
evening."  I don't recall going to Temple.  I do recall going to
church a few times, perhaps for celebrations for friends or friends
of the family.

So why do I think of myself as Jewish?  Well, my parents were Jewish.
We seem to have a Jewish perspective on life (or at least an
East-coast Jewish perspective on life; there are likely many Jewish
perspectives on life).  I recall when I was a young faculty member,
the College hosted a panel on religious perspectives.  And when
Katya Gibel spoke about her relationship to the world and relationship
to G-d, it was clear that that was my worldview.  Not Monessa
Cummins' Catholic worldview.  Not Henry Rietz's Protestant worldview.
Not the Muslim worldview, although I'm not sure that it was presented.
But something very similar to Katya's.

I know that the worldview or perspective comes out at times when I
debate or argue or look at minuscule points.  It comes out at other
times, too.  I wish I could identify them.  In any case, I'm a Jew,
if not a religious or observant Jew.

What's the point of all this?  Well, when I opened the newspaper
yesterday, I was stunned by what was on the front cover.  No, not
the picture of Steven Sharpe in a GHS _Music Man_ shirt [2,3].  But
a story about a recent event at Grinnell Middle School.  Here's what
it read [4].

> Grinnell school district officials and the Grinnell Police Department
  last week received reports of an offensive video sent to a Grinnell
  Middle School Student and posted on social media.  The video caused
  the student to be afraid to attend school for several days, and those
  who made the video have reportedly been suspended.

> According to Grinnell Police Chief Michael McClelland, "The 10-second
  video shows several male juveniles walking through a school hallway
  in a goose step manner with their right arms extended and palms
  down.  The video was titled 'Hitler Gang' along with several
  racist and derogatory hashtags attached.

> Grinnell Supt. Janet Stutz says the video was "very clearly" filmed
  in a Grinnell Middle School hallway[.]

You know those metaphors?  "A chill ran down my spine."  "I felt
like I was punched in the gut."  "My heart stopped." [5]  "I was
so shaken that I couldn't move."  Statements like that?  They all
apply.  None apply.  Some.  All.  I was stunned.  Frightened.
Overwhelmed.  I knew such hatred exists, but I didn't know that it
existed in my town.  What the \[fill in profanity\] is going on
with these kids that they think such a thing is appropriate to do?
What kind of parents do they have?

The last time I felt such a shock was when one of my favorite
students shared a letter that someone left in his mailbox.  I don't
recall the exact words, but it was something close to "Matthew
Shepard got what he deserved.  You deserve it too."  That was worse;
I was so shaken, I couldn't teach that day.

Unfortunately, that type of hatred also comes into play here.  It
appears that the poor kid targeted by the video is also non-binary,
and has been suffering through attacks for that, too.

What has happened to our community?  I know that Grinnell has some
problems, and Grinnell has always had problems, but, as my kids
remind me, our high school study body has elected gay students as
Homecoming King, which has always suggested inclusion to me.  (It's
also elected students of color, students who only recently moved
to Grinnell, and other kinds of "outsiders" as Homecoming King and
Queen.)

Are we not that town anymore?  Were we ever that town?

I've faced challenges as a Jew.  The college classmate from Nebraska
who reached up to my forehead to see if she could feel the horns.
The casual acquaintance who talked about "Jewing down" a price.
The so-called Christians who don't even know what Passover is [6].
The people who have walked up to me on the street and started the
conversation with "You're Jewish, right?"  The mild Midwesterners
who take offense at my enthusiasm for confronting things.  Okay,
the last few aren't as bad as the first two things, but they are
all things shaped by who I am and by a world that doesn't necessarily
like people like me.

In any case, none of those experiences affected me like reading the
first three paragraphs of the article did.  This one seems much
harder to just set aside.  I'm not quite sure why.

I'd like to just say "I blame Trump" or "I blame the new Republican
party" or even "I blame that idiot on the corner of 6th and Prairie
with the horrendous signs", but I know that's not accurate enough.
There's something seriously wrong with our town, our state,  our
country, our world that such hate is possible, that people feel so
free to treat others badly.

What happened to "love thy neighbor", to "do unto others as you
would have them do unto you", to "don't do to others what you would
not want to be done to you", and all those related rules?

I wish I knew.

I realize that I'm "late to the table" on this one, in many ways.
I don't have kids in the school district anymore, so I didn't see
notices from the superintendent.  I'm not on Facebook all that much,
so I didn't see the notices there.  And I haven't had many casual
conversations [7].  So while I'm sure others have known about this
for a while, I have not.

More broadly, I haven't paid enough attention to the other instances
of hatred in this town, in our schools.  I'm pretty sure that it's
not a new thing.

I find myself wondering how I tell anyone with kids that they should
move to this town.  And that makes me sad.  I found Grinnell a great
place to live and to raise my kids.  I've said that for years.  When
will I be able to say it again?

**_Postscript_**: This musing did not go in the direction I expected.
Perhaps it's because I didn't read the whole article before starting;
I'd been too shocked by the start.  Perhaps it's because I muse to
think things through, and while my initial reaction was shock,
thinking things through led me to an odd sense of horror.  In any
case, I need to stop writing now, even though the musing is more
disjoint [8] than I would hope.

[1] The Spiesmans, most frequently.  At least once at Eileen and Larry
Schwartz's.  I can't recall where else.

[2] Without a narwhal!

[3] The mention of the Sharpest student was included to amuse the
members of my advisory board.

[4] I suppose it still reads the same.

[5] That one would be bad.

[6] Do you not even pay attention to your savior's story?

[7] I blame the pandemic.

[8] less joint?
