Last fall, President Harris posted a letter about inclusion at Grinnell.
While I very much support inclusion, I worried about the ways in which
her letter might be taken, particularly given some issues on campus and
some events in the broader academic community.

Since then, we've had some conversations and I've also discussed the
issues with others.  I am not sure where I stand on all of these issues.
I continue to support inclusion.  I continue to believe that the President
has a responsibility to support the faculty.  I don't know the best
approach to balancing those issues.

In any case, I see no benefit to leaving the letter up.

I look forward to further campus conversations on these issues.
