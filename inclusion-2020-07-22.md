**_Content Warning_**: This musing contains slurs.  As I suggest
in the letter, I find it necessary to write the explicit slurs,
rather than euphemisms, in order to make my point.  If you might
be harmed by the m-word/s-word pairing, the G-word, the J-word when
used as a verb, the i-word, or a statement that may not correspond
to your beliefs, you should not read beyond these first two paragraphs.
You might consider asking someone else to read and summarize the
letter.  You could also skip to the end for the TL;DR, but you will
miss most of the argument and context.

As I suggest at the end of this document, these opinions are mine
and should not be interpreted to be those of Grinnell College or
any other actor.

**_Background_**: Yesterday, President Harris sent a campus-wide email
about the use of "racial slurs" in the classroom.  While I care about
providing an inclusive classroom, when I read her letter, I found myself
getting increasingly furious.  This musing represents my response.

Dear President Harris and Dr. Rivera,

I read with anticipation President Harris' letter to the campus
community about anti-racist work at the College.  As you know, I
care deeply about providing an inclusive classroom and supporting
students who embody a wide variety of identities.  Diversifying the
CS classroom has been one of my primary goals for the twenty-plus
years I have been at Grinnell.

President Harris: As you know from our interactions, I respect you
highly and I am happy that someone with your approach to the liberal
arts, your enthusiasm for broad collaboration, and your concerns
for inclusion and equity is now president of this college I love.

Dr. Rivera: I have not had the opportunity to speak with you
individually.  Nonetheless, I have heard good things about you, I
support the work of the Chief Diversity Officer, and I look forward
to being able to work with you to support Grinnell's students and
employees.

Your letter is not what I expected.  I cannot put my reaction to
the letter in a word or two or even a sentence of two.  Fortunately,
you have asked us for our "thoughts, ideas, and expertise".  I am
doing so in this open letter.  It is a bit longer than I intended.
For that, I apologize.  I find that I am also less articulate about
these issues than I know others will be.  Still, I find myself
compelled to write.

I am astounded that you did not begin your letter with a clear
assertion of the priority of academic freedom and the rights of
faculty to determine what to teach in their classroom and how to
teach it.  Given that a very vocal group of students is calling for
the firing of tenured faculty members, it is your obligation as
president to affirm the rights of faculty, even if you believe that
faculty should have taken different actions.  Presidents at other
institutions have been able to say "While I do not support the
language my faculty have used in the classroom, I very much support
their right to use it in an academic setting." You should have done
the same.  I hope that you will rectify this issue immediately.

I am angered that the language in your letter targets a particular
faculty member whose own letter on the subject has been posted
repeatedly on social media, posted by the same students who are
calling for the termination of that faculty member's contract.  That
you twist that faculty member's words to suggest that they were
intentionally causing harm is particularly problematic.

Beyond those initial troublesome issues, I also find myself in
opposition to the way you choose to approach the use of racial slurs
in the classroom.

In part, my opposition is based on the generalization from the
n-word, which appears to have been at the root of some recent
complaints, to the use of all racial slurs.  This is not my area
of expertise, but I have tried to read regularly on the subject.
As I understand it, many scholars of race and people of color
consider the n-word so charged that it should be treated separately
from all other slurs.  Since that word is not targeted at me, I
accept their claim.  I have never spoken the term, not even in an
academic context nor in reading a poem or book out loud.  I would
discourage others, including the faculty member you seem to be
targeting in your letter, from using it.

At the same time, I know that many Black scholars believe that there
are appropriate reasons to use the word in the classroom. Some
suggest that to read James Baldwin or other poets who use the word
aloud while changing their words is an insult to their work.  I
expect that some scholars of language or culture may find a need
to use it.  I believe that most uses in the classroom are very
intentional and carefully considered.  I also know that there are
a few times when the use is quite accidental, as in discovering the
word in a work being read aloud.  I have certainly seen the latter
reported in the higher education press.  Neither use deserves
condemnation.  Both might warrant discussion, perhaps about why
alternatives would be better in the former case, perhaps about how
to avoid such situations in the latter.  

Nonetheless, in the first case, the use should remain the decision
of the faculty member.  If a faculty member anticipates potential
harm, we might encourage them to provide advance warning to students,
to allow students to skip the class or activity, and to provide an
alternative for those students.  If their use causes unanticipated
harm, we might expect them to discuss the issue with students, a
discussion which includes not only time for the students to describe
their won experience, but also time for the faculty member to explain
their pedagogical rationale.  Treat it as a learning experience.
After all, learning is what we do.

Leaving aside the n-word, which I can see some reasons to forbid,
I am very troubled by the broader infringement on speech that
disallowing all slurs creates.  In part, it is difficult to discuss
biased words without using them.  Let me give you some examples.
Although I teach a technical field, I still find times that I discuss
slurs in the classroom.

As you noted, sometimes these slurs come from the history of our
discipline.  Computer science uses the terms "Master" and "Slave"
to talk about the relationship of different computations in a
parallel system.  I think it is important not just to stop using
those terms, but also to mention the prior terms.  

> We use the term "main" to describe the primary process and
"subsidiary" to describe the processes whose behavior is controlled
by the main process.  At one time, our field thoughtlessly used
"master" and "slave"; when you choose words and metaphors to describe
computation, please think about the implications and impact.  And
please let me know if you hear me using similarly problematic terms.

That explanation would not work if I said "our field thoughtlessly
used 'm-word' and 's-word'".

I can identify many other problematic terms and approaches in the
history of CS, but I shall not go into more depth here.

Some discussions of slurs arise contextually.  For many years, when
students talked about visiting Dairy Barn, I discussed the problematic
"Guinea Grinder" that they served and which was the norm in Iowa.
(I believe that the Iowa State Fair even had a competition.)  Enough
students have trouble understanding why the name is problematic
that saying "G-word Grinder" would not have worked.  Using "G-word"
also prevents discussion of the racist reasons why people of Italian
descent find the term a slur.  Should I have led such discussions?
I consider it part of my broader responsibility to help students
pay attention to the things they might miss, to acknowledge their
limited knowledge or experience, and to consider some of the
problematic issues in this state.  I also know that discussion of
such issues in a "science classroom" reaffirms their broader import.

I have discussed aspects of our community with my Tutorial students
and others so that they might know what to expect  In doing so, I
mention that people in town have told me that they "Jewed" down a
price.  Should I just say "J-worded"?  That they used my identity
as a way to talk about bargaining prices?

More broadly, the class of words that can be considered slurs is
huge, and we are unlikely to be able to identify all of them or
to prevent their use.  We should, of course, listen when someone
tells us that a word is problematic and reconsider our practices.
At the same time, we need to be able to discuss these words in
context, to talk about the history of a word like "idiot" and why
we should not use the term.

As I noted, it can be difficult to determine what a student might
consider a slur.  I have a Catholic student who gets very upset
when someone uses the term "propaganda" to mean biased or misleading
information since that use was developed as a way of insinuating
negative attributes to the Catholic Church, whose Propaganda was
an administrative body.

I do not dispute that we should think more carefully about the
language and signs we use.  I have complained in the past about the
College's use of the word "brand", which has a terrifying and painful
history; those complaints were ignored.  I and others have asked
for the removal of the banner on 8th that reads "Live Vocally";
ironically, our voices were ignored.  I know that when some older
Jews first entered the old Darby, they were stunned at being
confronted by a vast array of what seem to be red and black iron
crosses.  While I know that few words approach the level of the
n-word, I expect that the visceral experience of seeing what seem
to be signs of hatred and murder is comparable.  Still, I would not
suggest eliminating the Honor G.  I would, however, advocate for
some clear warnings.

I realize that many students consider slurs harmful; I believe that
students feel harm.  But I do not believe that faculty use the terms
to cause harm, and they certainly do not do so out of some sense
that there is value in causing harm.  They primarily use the terms
because they have decided that the use plays an important role in
their pedagogy, and they do so relying on their education and their
pedagogical and disciplinary expertise.  I also know that our
students have the capabilities to handle such complex discussions;
they are bright, inquisitive, and capable of dealing with both
complexities and painful subjects.

Please trust that the Grinnell faculty understand the damaging power
of slurs, that when they use them intentionally in class, they have
done so for good and informed reasons, and that when they use them
unintentionally, we are better off helping them understand the issues
at play then condemning them.

In your letter, you note that that you will be "working with diversity
and inclusion professionals across campus".  I expect that you will
also be working with the faculty to consider how we address issues
of inclusion while affirming the expertise of the faculty.

To summarize (or TL;DR, as the modern generation writes), I hope
you will reaffirm the sanctity of our classrooms and the expertise
of the faculty, that you will apologize to the faculty member or
members you have targeted, that you will support policies that
acknowledge that there are times that it is appropriate for faculty
to use slurs (excepting, perhaps, the n-word), provided they have
considered the potential impacts the slurs can have, and that you
will ensure that the faculty have the primary role in developing
policies regarding our classes.

I look forward to further campus discussions of these important
matters.
