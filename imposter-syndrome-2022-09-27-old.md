I assume that many of my readers in the tech industry and in academia
know about the concept of "Imposter Syndrome".  It's a way to describe
the feeling that many of us regularly have that, well, we do not belong
in our chosen profession because we are not as smart, or competent, or
engaged, or ... as those around us.  Somehow, we have managed to fool
other people that we belong, but we know in our heart of hearts that
we don't.

People often feel imposter syndrome when they do not identify with
the majority group in their area.  For example, many women in tech suffer
from imposter syndrome, including some of the smartest people I know.

People in majority groups can also experience imposter syndrome.
At least I do.  And I'm an upper-middle class, male, heterosexual,
cisgender, married, white-presenting [1] professional in fields
(academia, tech) dominated by such people.  Still, I sometimes worry
that I know so much less about computer science than my junior
colleagues or, say, my youngest son and find myself asking whether
I belong.  I regularly feel that I'm not on the same intellectual
plane as colleagues across the institution and, once again, wonder
whether I really belong, or whether I should really try to participate
in discussions.

I had a severe case of imposter syndrome the other week.  I was
at the banquet for the CMD-IT/ACM [2,3] Richard Tapia
Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference [4].  And then,
on the screen, I saw my name and photo.  Then they announced that
I had received this year's "Outstanding Service" award.

My first reaction?  "Why me?"  That is, I found myself wondering
why I'd get such an award.  Yes, I do a lot for Tapia [5].  But
many people do tremendous work for the celebration: the CMD-IT
staff, who always go above and beyond; the conference chairs; the
many track chairs, who deal with all sorts of complexities; our
Student Volunteers chair, who graciously herds cats [6] and has
done so for a decade or so; Valerie Taylor, who provides amazing
leadership; the people who participated in half a dozen sessions
at the conference; so many others.

I still find myself wondering the same thing.  Why me?  I don't
deserve it.  At least I deserve it much less than others.  Although
I am excited to have received it, I also kind of wish that I didn't.

I'm pretty sure those are symptoms of imposter syndrome.

So I'm trying to tell myself that I trust the opinions of the
Tapia leadership.  If they think I deserve the award, then I
probably deserve it.  I should feel good about myself.

Still, I'd prefer to see it go to one of the folks mentioned above.

In the end, I suppose the thing that matters most is that I've made
a positive difference in a community I value.  The award is secondary
to my service.  I look forward to continuing to try to do what I
can to help.

[1] Particularly because white supremacists do not consider me white,
I have trouble identifying as white.

[2] CMD-IT is the Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in
Information Technology.

[3] ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery.

[4] Isn't that a mouthful?

[5] The conference, not the person.

[6] Well, students.
