For those who don't understand the title of the musing, it stems from a linguistic urban legend. It seems that one of the earliest machine translation systems was built to translate English to Russian and vice versa. Someone fed the aphorism "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak" into the system, translating it from English to Russian and then back again. What came out was reportedly "The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten".

I've always treated the original aphorism as suggesting that there are things we want to achieve but can't necessarily succeed at because of some limitation. Google AI says that it means that "someone has good intentions but fails to live up to them". Google also reminds me that it's a biblical quote, attributed to Jesus. That context suggests something a bit more spiritual, something related to faith and temptation. I think I'll stick with the more secular version.

In any case, I've found that the aphorism applies to my everyday life. Each night I go to bed with high expectations for the next day. In particular, I expect that I'll get up early, and I'll accomplish a slew of tasks. That's my spirit. Then the morning hits, and I struggle to get out of bed. Often, there's physical exhuastion. Since the heart attack, I've needed more sleep. I also don't always sleep well. And, some nights, I have difficulty falling asleep. I also struggle to get out of bed for other reasons, not all of which I can identify. Some likely relate to depression. Others may include a desire to avoid more complicated or less pleasant tasks. Let's blame it on the exhuastion.

As the aphorism suggests, my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak.

Of course, it's more complicated than that. I don't have measures, but I seem to take longer to get things done than I used to. I also have too many things on my "to do" list. That's a long-standing problem, and, while it's gotten a bit better, it's not sufficiently better. I've also become a bit more willing to give up. "It's 7 p.m. (or 6 p.m., or 8 p.m.); I should be done for the night."

Perhaps I need a new aphorism. How about "_The vodka may be strong, but it's been watered down_"?
