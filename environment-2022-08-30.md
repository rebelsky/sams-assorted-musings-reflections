Last Friday, Beronda Montgomery, Grinnell's new Dean of the College
/ Vice President of Academic Affairs, gave an excellent talk at
Community Friday [1].  One of the main themes of her presentation was that
we best serve students from [traditionally excluded
groups](terminology-2022-08-25) not by saying "here's how you have
to change", but by asking what resources these students need and
bringing them to the students [3].  After all, you don't tell a
plant "you need water"; you don't even show it where the water is.
You just water it.

As you might expect, that got me thinking about my recent frustrations
with Grinnell, particularly with Grinnell's treatment of my department.

For those who haven't been paying attention, here's where things stand.

* Computer Science is the largest major at Grinnell.  It has been for about
  five years running.  We graduate 60+ CS majors each year, approximately
  15% of the senior class.  That means we have approximately 120 CS
  majors for most of the year (and as many as 180 in late spring).
* We do not have enough CS faculty to support that many CS majors.  We
  certainly have fewer lines than many departments with fewer majors.
* Even though President Harris convinced the Trustees to add faculty lines,
  none of those added lines have gone to CS.  The signal we've received is
  that none of those lines will go to CS, unless it's to help leave-proof
  the department.

These things have implications.  I'll start with the direct implications
and then move on to the connections to Dean Montgomery's talk.

* Almost every CS class at Grinnell regularly fills to capacity (or over
  capacity).
* Because of that, we cannot ensure that every student who wants to take
  introductory CS can take introductory CS.  Fortunately, in recent years,
  we've been able to ensure that every first-year student who wants
  to take introductory CS can take introductory CS [4,5].
* Because of the high demand, some students must take minimal CS majors,
  even if they would prefer not to [6].
* The ratio of majors to faculty is so high that we are taking on
  absurdly many advisees.  The two chairs each have thirty advisees.
  Our other tenured faculty member has over twenty.  Our third-year
  faculty member has nineteen.  Our fourth-year faculty member also
  has about nineteen, and has kept them while on leave.  I'm also
  on leave, and I have fifteen.  And then there are the nontraditional
  advisors: an emeritus faculty member with more than fifteen remote
  advisees; a term faculty member leaving this year also with more
  than fifteen advisees;  a staff member with more than fifteen
  advisees [7].  For context, the average and median at the College
  are between twelve and thirteen.  Most of us don't think we can
  do an appropriately good job with more than eighteen [8].  And
  this isn't a new problem.  I raised the then-forthcoming issue
  with the Dean more than five years ago.  The solution at the time
  was that I take on almost sixty advisees to protect the untenured
  members of the department [9].

That is, most of us are pushed to our limits.  Some may be pushed
beyond their limits.  And that has negative impacts on our efforts
to broaden participation in computing.  Here are a few.

* There is clear evidence that students from groups historically underserved
  in computing do less well in crowded classes.
* High advising loads mean that we may not have the time or mental energy to 
  give the extra attention to students who need that attention.
* We have no room in our course offerings for additional courses that we think
  would make a positive difference, particularly a planned course in ethics and
  inclusion in computing.
* More broadly, we don't have time and energy for the extra work that helps to
  broaden participation.  For example, even though we know that CS
  Table has a positive impact on inclusion, no one had the time or
  energy to run CS Table last year.

I don't want to claim that the College hasn't helped the department.
Before the boom, we were supporting twelve to fifteen majors in
each class year with 4.6 regular FTE faculty.  We are now up to 8
regular FTE faculty, or we will be, if we succeed in a tenure-line
hire this year.  So we have grown.

However, we quadrupled or quintupled our number of majors.  That's
more than twice the increase in the number of faculty.  If
four-and-a-half bags of fertilizer [10] permits you to produce a
healthy, diverse crop of up to thirty plants [11] each year, as
well as to support some other flora and fauna [12], there's no
reason to think that eight bags would let you grow more than 120
plants.  What happens when there's not enough resources?  I expect
that the plants that are better at grabbing and holding resources
are most likely to thrive.  We become a monoculture, or close to
that, rather than the varied ecosystem we need.

Grinnell's repeated failure to grow our CS faculty makes me feel
like our institutional IDEA [14] goals don't include diversity in
CS.  That frustrates me.  Broadening participation in computing
reflects social justice goals.  I know you've probably heard me say
it before [15], but I need to say it again.  Computer technology
is changing the world.  We have an obligation to make sure that the
people who build that technology represent different backgrounds
and viewpoints.  It's not enough to teach the mostly monoculture
about other people; we need the other people in the field.  In
addition, computing provides a career that can make a huge financial
difference.  Just last spring, I heard from one of my students that
they were thrilled not only to be the first person in their families
to graduate college but also to have a job that pays well and that
lets them help support their family.  They are far from the first
who has told me something similar.  BPC [16] supports both those
social justice goals.  Of course, I also want to expose more people
to the wonder of computing, the joy that comes from solving problems,
building things, actually getting your code to run [17].

I won't even bother to describe the various ITS policies that have
interfered with our ability to continue to provide a top-notch CS
education and that have taken even more time away from our core
missions.  The financials are also an issue for another time.

At this point in my life, I don't have the energy both to support
BPC efforts and to keep trying to convince the powers-that-be at
Grinnell to provide the resources we require for such efforts.  I've
given my time.  I've given my money.  I've given my energy.  I may
have even given my health.  I only have so much left.  I'm done.
What little I have left should go BPC efforts, not to fighting.

Either Grinnell will figure it out or it won't.  I'm hoping that with
our amazing new Dean, it will.

**_Postscript_**: Believe it or not, but I cut a lot out of this rant.  
And I didn't even start to write everything I planned.  As I said,
I'm done [18].

[1] I'm so glad that it is now Community Friday rather than Faculty Friday.
The term Community Friday appropriately includes much more of the campus
community, particularly staff [2].

[2] I'm not sure if it includes students.  But that's okay, sometimes we need
a place just for faculty and staff.

[3] Apologies to Dean Montgomery for my inadequate restatement of her lecture.

[4] I think we've been able to ensure that every prospective CS major could
take introductory CS.

[5] I'll admit that I've gone so far as to teach extra sections of CSC-151
to ensure that this happens.  My health won't permit that any more.

[6] Some of us believe that minimal majors are better, because it gives the students
a broader liberal arts education.  However, students should have some say in the 
matter.

[7] Do you worry that this approach violates Grinnell's promise of
faculty advisors?  You shouldn't.  All of them are double majors
and therefore have faculty advisors.  Our staff member is also an
amazing advisor.

[8] A few faculty members at Grinnell voluntarily take on more advisees.  That
doesn't mean others should be forced to do so.

[9] I find it concerning that the two faculty members in recent history who were
effectively forced to take on absurdly large numbers of advisees both had significant
health issues son thereafter.

[10] I like thinking of faculty as bags of fertilizer.

[11] 15 majors per year, third-years and seniors.

[12] Nonmajors.

[14] I prefer IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility) or AIDE
(you can figure it out), rather than just DEI.

[15] Or read it when I write it.

[16] Broadening Participation in Computing.

[17] Gotta love that dopamine hit.

[18] Will I succeed at being done?  I'm not sure.  I've said it before.  I just
need to stay focused: Spend time on what I can effect, not on what I cannot
affect [19].

[19] effect/affect spellings intentional.
