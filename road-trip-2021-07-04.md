Yesterday and today, Michelle and I drove back from our vacation
south of Virginia Beach.  I think the total distance was about
nineteen hours; we drove eleven or so hours the first day and seven
or eight the second day.  In the old days, we would have driven
straight through.  Before the heart attack, I might have tried to
do so this time, too.  However, I need more sleep these days than
I used to, and I get tired much more easily.  I did all the driving
and Michelle did the navigating.  She offered to drive, but I like
to drive.

Various signs and such along the way got me thinking about too many
things.  None are significant, but my muse suggests I should write
about them.  Here goes.

On I-64 West in Virginia, I saw a lot of signs that said something
like "Tractor-Trailers going 70 mph or less should use the right
lane".  Well, I guess one or two used "65 mph", but the concept was
the same.  I don't understand.  The speed limit was 70 miles per
hour (or 65).  Shouldn't *everyone* have been going 70 mph or less?
And does the sign implicitly acknowledge that most people treat
speed limits as lower limits?

I-70 was closed near Indianapolis.  That got me wondering.  I thought
US Interstates were built to ensure that we could transport missiles
and move our military around.  Don't closed Interstates make that more
difficult?

Then I thought about other aspects of the Interstates that would
seem to make transport harder.  That sharp right on I-80 in Cleveland
where the speed drops to 25 mph or so.  Toll booths, although those
are being replaced by I-Pass lanes.  The many, many places along the
Interstates where things go down to one lane for construction. 

Don't the one-line highway sections violate the purpose of the
Interstates?  I think missile transports are wider than the average
truck.  What would happen if we had a military emergency?

I was driving my new used car and eventually figured out how to use
the FM-radio scan system.  It took surprisingly long to figure that
out.  Anyway, I ended up on 88.1 somewhere in Illinois or Indiana.
I'm not sure where.  I think it was outside of Indianapolis, but I
find myself questioning that.  They were playing some kind of Klezmer
music.  I listened for a bit, and then they said,

> It's 9:42; it time for bagpipes.

Isn't that awesome?  I love the chaos of independent radio stations

Burma Shave is long gone.  At least I think it is.  But some people
still put up Burma-Shave-like series of signs.  I saw a strange and
discomforting one this trip.  It went something like this.

> When things attack

> And you can't run

> You'll be glad

> You have a gun

Inspiring, isn't it?

Today was a great day to drive.  There was almost no traffic.  Who
would've thought that a big holiday would create *less* traffic?

---

The holiday weekend inspired the road message designers.  The first
one I recall is from Virginia.

> You're not a firework.  Don't drive lit.

If I had written it, it would be closer to

> You may be a firework, but it's dangerous to drive lit.

I think the next one in Virginia (or maybe Ohio) was

> You may be barbequing, but you shouldn't drive lit.

Illinois had a boring one.

> Don't speed.  Get vaccinated.  Be Safe.

Or something like that.

And yes, these fall into my normal bucket of "signs that could have
been better".

Remember those Virginia I-64 signs?  They got me thinking about the
different things signs say about the right lane.  

> Slower traffic keep right

> Trucks must use right lane

> Keep right except for passing

I wish people followed the last one.  That is, drivers should be
in the right lane unless they are passing someone in the right lane.
That would help eliminate the problem of annoying people who pass
on the right.  Or maybe not.  I've watched people pass on the right
on three-lane highways even when the left lane is available.

Well, that's all my muse can wring out of me right now.  That last
entry suggests that she wrung pretty hard.
