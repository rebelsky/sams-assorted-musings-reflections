Faculty encounter many challenges when they design classes.  One
such challenge is to choose the appropriate textbook to support
student learning.  Some of us eschew textbooks and provide our own
handouts or encourage students to pick up whichever one of a few
textbooks we suggest.  Some find a reliable book and use it semester
after semester.  Others rotate textbooks regularly.  And some faculty
even teach in disciplines that are not naturally amenable to
textbooks.

It may not surprise you to hear that students don't particularly
like buying textbooks.  There are many reasons.  The cost has always
been one obstacle.  At times, textbook pricing feels like a racket.
I know a lot of work goes into creating a good textbook, but (a)
not all textbooks are good and (b) pricing often appears excessive.
I know that my offspring had courses that required a few hundred
dollars worth of textbooks.  I realize that many textbooks get
resold, but I still don't understand why a popular, "use once and
discard" lab manual for a language class should cost more than $100.

These days, many students seem to find electronic versions of
textbooks online.  It makes sense; it's much easier to carry 
something that adds no physical weight to your laptop or tablet
than to lug a giant book.  Unfortunately, the desire for "easy to
carry" often combines with the desire to save money, and some
students end up with questionably legal PDF copies.

When I see students using a questionably legal PDF, I tend to go
into rant mode.  The sermon I give often goes something like this.

> I chose this textbook rather than giving you a set of my notes
because I firmly believe you will learn better from the text.  You
will also benefit from having it on your shelf; it's an amazing
reference.

> Creating a textbook requires an enormous amount of work.  It
requires intellectual labor, time, revision, re-revision.  I had
the office next door to Tom Cormen's when he was making the index
for CLRS [1,2].  Tom wanted to make the index as comprehensive and
as useful as possible, which meant that he manually indexed all
thousand or so pages rather than relying on automatic software or
giving the task to someone with less expertise than him.  As I
recall, it required at least a month of full-time work.

> Especially as someone whose profession will involve creating
virtual objects (software), you should care that people who want
or need to receive compensation for their effort get that compensation.  I
realize that the book may be moderately expensive, but stealing is
not the appropriate response to excessive costs.  You could share
a book with a classmate.  You could rely on one of the copies in
the CS library [4].  Please make the legal choice; it's also the
ethical one.

Why do I use Tom Cormen as my example, rather than, say, Henry
Walker [5], my mother [6], or myself [7]?  I'm not sure.  Perhaps
because students know CLRS and can understand the work involved.

When I drop out of rant mode, I also admit that there are times
that I consider it ethical, if not strictly legal, to use an
electronic textbook that you found on the Interweb.  For example,
you might own the physical version, which you keep on your desk,
and carry the electronic version for convenience [8].  I
also consider it reasonable to use an electronic version to check
an alternative perspective on one or two small issues; others may not.
But if you plan to use a textbook for the semester, you should
either pay for it or use a library copy.

_Amazingly, I intended all of the preceding to serve as the background
to another rant.  I could also muse or rant more about textbook
choices, but my muse says that those should be tasks for the future.
In any case ..._

The other day, I was looking at a website for an algorithms course.
Here's what the syllabus says.

> There is no required textbook. Lecture notes will be posted after every lecture. However, the material is mostly going to be from the following two books, and I will give pointers to them as well.

> * (DPV) _Algorithms_ by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani
> * (CLRS) _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein

> Students don't have to buy any of the above books. Indeed, if you Google, you may find pdf copies on the web. You are, however, not allowed to look at or refer to the solutions manuals for these books [9].

And the course is *at Dartmouth*, where Tom Cormen spent his career and
Cliff Stein taught for many years.  All I find myself doing is asking
about Whiskey Dances [10,11].  More precisely,

* Why is a faculty member suggesting that others bootleg their colleague's 
  book?  Or any book?  "[Y]ou may find pdf copies on the web" should
  be followed immediately by something like "It is unethical
  to use those PDFs unless you have paid for legitimate copies."
* Why would an instructor expect students to follow the third
  sentence of the paragraph when they've already told students to
  discard ethics in the second sentence?

I shouldn't complain about someone else's syllabus.  I'm sure that
there are endless flaws in my syllabi.  

Nonetheless ...  Whiskey Dances? [14]

**_Postscript_**: Feel free to deride my syllabi.  Feel free to
Derrida-ide my syllabi [15], for that matter.  The musings are also fair
game.  Rants, too.

[1] Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein.  _Introduction to Algorithms_.  MIT Press.

[2] The first CLRS, which makes it the 2nd edition. I think. [3]

[3] The first edition was just CLR.

[4] I realize that authors make the same additional money from
the questionably legal copy and the copy in the library. However,
we did purchase the copy in the library, so they received some
compensation.

[5] Henry has written a dozen or so textbooks.

[6] Mom wrote a few textbooks on Child Psych.

[7] I wrote one mediocre lab manual on Java.  I think I got $2,000
for it.

[8] I am not alone in this perspective.  The Ethicist column in
_The New York Times_ says [much the same thing](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/magazine/04FOB-ethicist-t.html).

[9] Link elided to protect the [fill in the blank].

[10] The dances are the Foxtrot and the Tango, although not in that order.

[11] Someday I'll memorize the NATO Phoenetic Alphabet [12].

[12] I just learned that at least one version of the NATO Phoenetic Alphabet suggests that "Victor" should be pronounced "Vik Tah".  The influence of Bostonians appears to range widely.

[14] I considered writing "Still ... Whiskey Dances?", which provides
additional opportunities for puns.  However, I could not fire myself
up for the task.  I also remain unsure whether "Whiskey Dances" was
the appropriate alternate to WTF.  Is it too obscure?

[15] Deride-a?
