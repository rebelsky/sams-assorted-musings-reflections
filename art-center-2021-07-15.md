Yesterday, I took my research students to the Des Moines Art Center.  I
try to take my research students to the Art Center every year.  We often
do work related to image making, and I think it's helpful to look at the
variety of images and approaches represented at the Art Center.  I also
think experience with culture (cultures?) is appropriate.  And it's an
excuse to go out to lunch together to build community [1].

While at the Art Center, I saw two colleagues from the Humanities
whose last names differ by only the first letter.  They made an
all-too-common comment, "It's nice that we have science faculty who
value the arts."  And then they asked the question that folks usually
ask other people when they meet at a museum,

> What's your favorite piece?

I've been visiting the Art Center for long enough that it's hard to pick
just one.  And so I gave multiple answers.

> There are lots of pieces of love here, not all of which are on display
  right now.  One of my favorites involves carefully traced and cut lines
  on paper.  It's fragile, so I don't think it can be displayed for very
  long.  I haven't seen it in a few years [3].

> I also love the [Donald Judd steel boxes](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/37087/untitled;jsessionid=8DB33A0E178C609C7C3D12222103C07A)
  that are normally in the big sculpture room [4].

> And of course, I enjoy the [Maya Lin glass globes](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/40843/rock-field?ctx=22398151-a57c-41c2-b47f-9896f7129771&idx=1) and [the terrifying plaster-cast bodies that remind me of the holocaust](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/37257/the-flock-ii?ctx=44f14595-244b-4607-8459-f540d61cac80&idx=0) [5].

Can you tell that I'm a materials person?  That isn't to say
that I don't love, say Hoppers'
[_Automat_](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/41752/automat?ctx=75d9b951-d1a6-48e0-b46e-58cd21e18702&idx=4)
or Francis Bacon's [_Study After VelÃ¡zquez's Portrait of Pope
Innocent X_](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/38136/study-after-velazquezs-portrait-of-pope-innocent-x?ctx=7bfc3596-b44d-4824-bb52-cd3e2ba114c8&idx=1) [6], but there's something I particularly appreciate
about materials.  Of course, I also find myself drawn to works with
patterns or algorithms, such as the Judd boxes or many of LeWitt's
wall drawings [7].

In any case, I moved on to current things.

> There were two still lives by Grant Wood [8] that I don't remember
  seeing before and I found compelling.  I'm not always a fan of
  Wood's landscapes or portraits, but there was something special
  about these.

> I always enjoy pieces by El Anatsui, and [the one that's up now](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/47848/basin?ctx=a9235954-1346-40ae-981f-060e132f9b6c&idx=2) is no exception [9,10].

> I like [the Elias Sime](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/50630/tightrope-noiseless-12?ctx=c91568ed-c64d-4949-8d64-404606d68cb3&idx=0), but I must admit that I prefer the ones with circuit boards.

I didn't mention that I still like his use of cinderblock-sized boards to
build his pieces.  I also didn't mention the joy I got from seeing the
Sime show at Hamilton.  I could have spent days there.  If I recall
correctly, I was able to fit in three hour-long visits.  But I did say
something else about the Sime.

> I'm trying to decide how I feel about placing the El Anatsui and
the Sime across from each other.  It feels a bit wrong, like an
imperialist comment on how African artists work with reused materials.

But maybe I'm overly sensitive these days.  I don't feel like there's
anything wrong with putting LeWitt and Lichtenstein in dialog across
from each other.  Perhaps one of my readers has a thought on the
prior issue.

Somewhere in all that commentary, I added one more comment.

> I especially enjoyed a new piece in that gallery; [a ceramic piece
  about the artist struggling with his mortality](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/50887/impression-of-the-artist-as-an-incorporeal-witness-to-the-ce?ctx=de146c78-5b56-46de-9cdf-326d79a3ec3f&idx=6) [11].

I appreciated the part where there seem to be traces of him kneeling
in worship to the central figure.  And I liked the statement that,

> Ceramics is the world's most fascinating hobby.

<img src="images/arneson-detail.png" width=600 alt="The detail from a sculpture, showing a marble, a variety of kinds o findentations, and the text 'Ceramics is the world's most fascinating hobby' in all caps.">

But that's a sculpture that will take a few hours to investigate.  And I
know that's how I should be spending my time at the museum [12]; focusing
on the details of a few pieces rather than quick overviews of many pieces.
Nonetheless, I was able to choose a few pieces to observe for ten minutes or so 
each, including [the famous John Singer Sargent](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/39810/portraits-de-mep--et-de-mlle-lp-portraits-of-edouar?ctx=a170e59b-4987-4899-88ad-bc285b9439a5&idx=1) [14].

Did I mention [the Goldsworthys](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/37533/three-cairns?ctx=e0455f4e-927d-43c5-be8f-4258e8aa808b&idx=1) to them?  That falls in the pieces I normally love to see, not least because of its connection to Grinnell.  I did tell my students about [the wonderful picture of the CERA cairn amidst a prairie burn](https://sculpturemagazine.art/disjunctions-in-nature-and-culture-andy-goldsworthy/).

Did my colleagues think that I was too enthusiastic about too much?  I
hope not.  I don't think so.

And I haven't covered all that I love about the Art Center.  My
other favorite part of visiting the Art Center is seeing relations
to Grinnell on the acquisition information.  The pieces donated by
or funded by, say, Louise R. Noun '29.  Names like "Cowles" and "Younker",
which may be that they were leading Des Moines figures who
donated to both the Art Center and Grinnell rather than Grinnell alums [15].
This visit was the first time I noticed that Gregg Narber '68
had donated [a large
sculpture](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/38291/sandstone-bench?ctx=f01df757-d9bc-4552-9f2a-880bdbeef77d&idx=1)
in the central courtyard.

What else?  I should mention that we also got a quick sneak peek
at the preparations for the Justin Favela show.  It looks like it
will be amazing.  I'm sad to hear that most of the work will be
ephemeral.

As always, I look forward to returning!

**_Postscript_**: I assume one of my colleagues will suggest that I
also expose my students to experimental theatre.  I'm open to suggestions.

---

**_Postscript_**: Yes, I also asked my colleagues what works they
appreciated.  One didn't answer. The other chose a stunning Rodin,
[_Nude Study for The Burghers of Calais: Pierre de
Wiessant_](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/41727/nude-study-for-the-burghers-of-calais-pierre-de-wiessant?ctx=f8f1da89-4ab6-4903-b978-7c160d5dd3ac&idx=5).  We spent a bit of time dissecting the expression and arm
gesture.

---

**_Postscript_**: I remember visiting the Art Center with mom.  I wish
we could have visited more.  I wish we could still.  I'm glad that I've
started to develop some of her habit of assuming that others know the
same artists I do.

---

**_Postscript_**: I don't love everything at the Art Center.  I've already
mentioned that the LeWitt wall drawing is not among my favorite LeWitts.  I
still have trouble appreciating or understanding Lewis de Soto's
[Shadow](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/41223/shadow?ctx=dc6f6c3b-60b5-4f17-a8d2-dac079116f86&idx=5)
[18].  I understand much of the theory behind Jeff Koons' [_New
Shelton Wet/Dry Triple
Decker_](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/41081/new-shelton-wetdry-triple-decker?ctx=0f8277a8-eb48-402f-ba83-06dc8a8d2e05&idx=0),
but it's not a piece I need to visit with and I don't find it as
groundbreaking as earlier readymades.  However, I do appreciate
the IP issues that Koons' work raises, intentionally or
[unintentionally](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-jeff-koons-8-puppies-lawsuit-changed-artists-copy).

**_Postscript_**: What are *your* favorite pieces at the Art Center?

---

[1] We had hoped to go to A Dong, but it was only doing take-out.  We
settled on Zombie Burger.  I think A Dong would have been healthier for
me [2].

[2] I got a mushroom sandwich, which is better than most things.  And I
avoided the shakes.

[3] I wish I could remember the artist's name.

[4] I couldn't remember Donald Judd's name.

[5] _The Flock II_ by Magdalena Abakanowicz.

[6] A student and I spent some time with that piece this time.

[7] However, I find the Art Center's [LeWitt wall painting](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/39672/wall-drawing-601-forms-derived-from-a-cube-25-variations?ctx=b63cba61-514a-4033-b0b5-17c4d3889065&idx=11) less compelling than
many of his other works.  I like the [_Modular Piece_ sculpture](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/46201/modular-piece;jsessionid=80B4DBF508395236B6FACAAF697F8436), but that's not currently where I'm used to seeing it in the Pappajohn Scuplture Garden.  I see that [it moved inside for a bit](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHgZDVAHupG/), but it's not now on display.

[8] [_Vegetables_](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/38200/vegetables?ctx=f0352e48-a0cd-4922-98bf-00dd94a9633c&idx=4) and [_Basket of Fruit_](https://emuseum.desmoinesartcenter.org/objects/38643/basket-of-fruit?ctx=f0352e48-a0cd-4922-98bf-00dd94a9633c&idx=5).

[9] See!  More materials.

[10] In this visit, I learned that the El Atansui pieces drape differently
each time they are hung.  I would have expected that they had more of a
fixed form.  But I guess they are a kind of fabric, and fabric does not
always drape in the same way.

[11] Robert Arneson's _Impression of the Artist as an Incorporeal
Witness to the Center of the Universe_.

[12] Thanks, Chen!

[14] I may be a materials person, but I also appreciate painting.

[15] Noun was a Grinnell alum.  She also funded our women's studies
program, or at least created a named professorship [16].

[16] Well, I guess [that was really her brother, Joe Rosenfield '25](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/gender/noun/louise-noun) [17].

[17] In four years, are we going to rename the JRC to "The Joe
Rosenfield 1925 Center"?  If we do, I'll no longer be able to make
John Stone's "Joe's Quarter" joke.

[18] Even after listening to [the audio
tour](https://soundcloud.com/des-moines-art-center/shadow).
