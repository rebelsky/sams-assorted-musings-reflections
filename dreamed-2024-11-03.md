Do you know the song "Joe Hill"? If so, you might match these lyrics to the music. If not, perhaps they stand on their own.

> I dreamed I saw Michelle last night,

> A laying in our bed.

> I asked, Michelle can that be you?

> "I'm here, but yes I'm dead." 

> "I'm here, but yes I'm dead."

In all seriousness (although I suppose that was serious), I did dream of Michelle last night. She was laying next to me in bed. I knew that she was dead. She knew that she was dead. But she was there. I wasn't sure how substantial she was, so I asked her if I could still touch her, and she said yes. And it felt so nice to hold my wife in my arms. 

Did I know it was a dream? In some way, I must have. The dead don't come back. The cremated dead don't tend to have their old corporal form. So maybe I said, "This must be a dream." If so, she probably responded "It's okay; I'm still here."

In any case, we talked. We talked about the boys. I asked why she came back now. She said that she thought I needed help with the paperwork, or at least answers to help with the paperwork. And she's right. Or she was right. That is, I need help with the paperwork and I needed help when she visited me.

Unfortunately, I can't recall the rest of the dream. Like many dreams (or many of my dreams) it spun a bit out of control. I remember meeting with lawyers and such, but I don't remember what we talked about or even if any of it was related to my current paperwork.

It doesn't matter. I'm going to hold on to the first part of the dream. It was great to see Michelle again and to hold her. I hope I get many such chances in the future.

Even if they are only dreams.
