It's midway through my twenty-fifth year at Grinnell.

I've been fortunate.

Quite fortunate.

Amazingly fortunate.

&nbsp;

I'm paid to teach, which is my joy, my passion, my vocation.

I've had the privilege to teach incredible people.

People who are incredible in so many ways.  Not just nice, or smart, or
hard working.  People who can make a difference.  More than that, too.
I can't put it into words.  Let's stick with one word, incredible.

Through teaching, advising, mentoring, promoting, cajoling, and
even just chatting, I have sometimes made a difference to these
incredible people.  I like to think it's a positive difference.

I've also been able to study things that interest me and to involve
some of these incredible people in my studies.

I've served a discipline I love and an institution that I'd
become increasingly passionate about.

And I've had many opportunities to write.  I suppose everyone does.

&nbsp;

However ...

However ...

However, I find myself increasingly disconnected from this institution.

Perhaps I find the institution increasingly disconnected from me.

Perhaps both.

Others share these feelings.  Perhaps just a few; perhaps many.

&nbsp;

I've been pondering what has led to this disconnect.  Pondering, reflecting,
thinking, considering, studying, asking, writing, talking, shouting, screaming,
crying. 

I've tried to go beyond the harms and hurts, the things that frustrate
me so much I want to scream, the incursions on academic freedom, the
broken trust, the policies and procedures that make it harder for
me to do my job, the silences, the broken web of trust, the easy
dismissals, the rest.

I've pondered what's at the core.

I've pondered.

And pondered.

And pondered.

Perhaps I've pondered too much.  I've been known to do that from
time to time.  Perhaps.

&nbsp;

I may have an answer.  It may not be the only answer.  It may not
even be an accurate answer.  But it may suffice, for the time being.

More than a decade ago, back when Russell K was president, Mark
Schneider warned us that, unless we were proactive, Grinnell would
go from being an excellent academic institution with a large
endowment

&nbsp; &nbsp; to

a large endowment with an attached institution.

An academic institution; mustn't forget that.

And ...

And ...

And I don't have much more to say.

&nbsp;

Oh well.

&nbsp;

I will continue to teach.

I expect to continue to have the great fortune to teach incredible people.

Perhaps I will still make a difference to them.

I will also continue to have the great fortune to work with amazing
colleagues.  I neglected to mention that before.

I will continue to study things that interest me.  I'll continue
to involve students, at least if there's not too much additional
needless overhead involved.

I will continue to serve my discipline.

I'll continue to have opportunities to write.  I suppose everybody does.

&nbsp;

Reminder to self: It's just a job.
