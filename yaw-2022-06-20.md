This past weekend was "Young Alumni Weekend" [1] at Grinnell, an
alternate (second?) reunion for students who graduated in the past
ten years or so.  It provided something like an alternative
"graduation" for students in the class of 2020 as well as a chance
for the class of 2017 [2] to be together.  I think I heard that at
least half of the class of 2020 made it back to campus.

Class of 2020 students got a pancake breakfast with a few faculty
which ended with a short speech by President Harris and a recorded
commencement address by the person who would have been their
commencement speaker.  There was also a great picnic or two, Relays
[3], a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Harris [4], a 5K run [5], even
a "Cheers to Grinnell" at 10:10 one evening.


I don't know if a fabulous time was had by all, but a fabulous time
was definitely had by many.  

I certainly had a good time.

It was great to see so many alums I care about.  I had the privilege
to hear what people were doing with their careers and their lives.
I received some great hugs.  I discussaed art and computing, although
not simultaneously.  I learned about some alums doing important
things to improve society.  I ate some good food [6].  I even heard,
both directly and indirectly, that I had a positive impact on
people's lives.  I suppose that's what I regularly say about teaching
at Grinnell, "I get to make an impact on some awesome people."  I
just didn't realize that so many felt that way.

Despite these many positives, there were some negatives.  And
yes, I'm way too successful at identifying negatives.  But there
were negatives.

First of all, some alums in these cohorts who didn't make it back.
Although I saw many alums, I wish I'd seen more.  I suppose that
there's always email or phone or perhaps even other modes of
communication [7].

Second, I wish I'd had more time to chat with ceratain alums.  Some
are almost family (but I don't seem them as much as I see my family).
I'd intended more time with them, but I kept getting pulled away
for yet another person to say hi to.

But the worst part was that I didn't recognize everyone and couldn't
remember everyone's name.  In part, that's because I'm traditionally
bad at names.  In part, that's because the number of CS alums keeps
increasing, although not exponentially.  In part, the events of the
past year and a half have affected me [8].  I hate forgetting; it's
awful hearing that I'm important to someone (or just having someone
say hi) and feeling that I can't even remember their name.
Unfortunately, it's not under my control; it's not even a sign that
I don't care.

So, ...

* If you didn't make it back for YAW, I'm sorry that I didn't
  get to see you.  Please drop me a note.
* If you made it back for reunion and we didn't get enough time to
  talk, let's find some more time to talk some more.
* If you made it back from reunion and I was not appropriately
  attentive or seemed a bit confused, I'm so very sorry.  You are
  important to me, too, but my memory is not always perfect.

Most importantly: I'm thankful that I've had the chance to teach
so many wonderful people and I'm thankful I got to see so many of
them this weekend, if even for a minute or two.

I look forward to the next reunion, the next YAW, the next CS
affinity reunion, and any other opportunities I have to interact
with these wonderful people.

And **Thanks DAR!!!!** [9].  It was an amazing event.

**_Postscript_**: There's another regret, too.  I wasn't able to
be in Grinnell for the primary Grinnell reunion.  I'm sorry that I
couldn't be here for that.  I missed some alums who are incredibly
important to me.  I hope to get other opportunities to see them
in the near future.

**_Postscript_**: Come to think of it, I'm also sorry that I didn't
wear my academic robes to Profs and Pancakes.  Since it was a
substitute graduation, robes would have been appropriate.

[1] "YAW", in TLA-speak.
 
[2] I'd forgotten that I was an honorary member of that class for a moment.

[3] I asked a senior faculty member whether it was like the Relays of
old.  They said that while the particular games have changed, the
community and drinking seemed much the same.

[4] I'm sorry, but that sounds terrifying to me.

[5] I'm told that it's not a good idea to try to keep up with the
Cross Country runners.

[6] Thanks Dining Services / Catering!  I heard that alums particularly
appreciated how much fruit there was.

[7] I hear that these other modes of communication became more popular
during the height of the pandemic.

[8] Michelle says that anesthesia is particularly bad for my brain.
The heart attack wasn't great, either.

[9] Development and Alumni Relations.
