This year, Grinnell is sending about a dozen students to the
CMD-IT/ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing
Conference [1].  If I recall correctly, three have scholarships
from the conference, two are supported by the STARS Alliance, three
by the Wilson program, and three-and-a-half [2] by the CS department's
restricted fund and BPC fund [3].

Whenever we send students to a conference, I try to have a
pre-conference conversation on what to expect.  Since not all twelve
students could make it to the session, I thought I'd try to put it
in writing.  I'm also hoping that if I write down the details, I'll
do a better job of remembering in future years.  Perhaps others
will find it useful to adapt it to their own situations.

**Introductions**

Please share your name, major and year, and something that excites you
about the Tapia Celebration [4].

_Personally, I'm excited about being in a place where most people
do not look like me.  Given the ways in which computing changes the
world, I think we need all voices to participate in the development
of computing technology.  That's particularly true because evidence
suggests that White and Asian males are not particularly good at
envisioning the experiences of people different than themselves._

_I also have many friends in the Tapia community.  I look forward
to seeing them in person._

_I've also heard from many of you that you value the opportunity
to embrace your identity in a group of computer scientists.  I
look forward to supporting you._

**About The Tapia Celebration**

As you know and have experienced, the field of computer science is
not nearly as diverse as it should be.  About twenty-five years
ago, a group of professional computer scientists formed the Tapia
Celebration to help provide and build community for people from
groups historically excluded from CS and to help support students
from those groups.  The early focus was on domestic people of
color (aka Brown and Black people).  It has since grown to include
people with disabilities and women.  At least I think it includes
women; the Grace Hopper Celebration is a much larger conference to
support women in computing, so Tapia does not always feel like it
needs to provide extra support for women.  In my experience, Tapia
does less well for those not on the gender binary, but I hope that's
changing.  The [oSTEM](https://www.ostem.org) conferences also
provide a home for LGBTQ+ students.

Tapia is generally a manageable size.  I think there will be about
1600 people there this year.  Hopper, in contrast, has twenty
thousand or more.  And, while it is amazing and empowering to be
with tens of thousands of women computing professionals [5], it's
also nice to be in a less overwhelming place.  Students who have
attended both tell me that they appreciate Tapia's size and the
greater ability to talk to people one-on-one.  It's also been my
experience that Tapia focuses much more on undergraduates, trying
to help them persist and succeed (and consider graduate school).

**Goals for The Tapia Celebration**

Man folks are involved in getting you to the Tapia Celebration, and
each has its own set of goals for you attending Tapia.

_The Tapia Celebration's_ primary goals are what I've described
before.  It's intended to help build community and to support
students in CS.  Tapia also has the implicit goal that you come
back to your home institution and further build community.  You
can help build community by meeting people at Tapia.  For some,
that will be easy.  For introverts like me, it will be harder.
But please try.

_Grinnell College CS's_ goals for sending students to Tapia are
primarily to help provide better support for our students who don't
get to see many people like them in the department.  As we've said,
this year we also want the Tapia attendees to commit to building a
better infrastructure for historically excluded students to supplement
existing structures.  In case you're not sure, these are some of
our primary structures to help broaden participation: the Women and
Gender Minorities in Computing group, the Computing Peers United
(CPUs) program; our Peer Mentoring and Tutoring program; active
discussion of BPC issues in our courses, particularly in CSC-151;
and CS Table, where we try to include some regular discussion of
these issues [6].  They are not enough.  You've had some good ideas
of other things to do, and we will learn of others at the Celebration.
I hope to find funding so that your time spent building BPC
infrastructure is appropriately compensated.

_Grinnell's Wilson Program's_ goals revolve around leadership and
innovation.  Spend some time thinking about these issues at the
Celebration and be prepared to report back.

_STARS_ wants us to use our time at Tapia to help build infrastructure
at individual institutions to broaden participation in computing.
It also supports connections between institutions on those issues.
We'll be collaborating with STARS throughout the year on these
issues.

_You_ likely have your own goals.  It sounds like most of you are
going for reasons similar to those above, particularly to have a
chance to embrace who you are in an environment in which there are
many more people who look like you.  I know that some students go
to Tapia primarily because of the Career Fair.  And it's fine that
you take advantage of the Career Fair as a way to find internships
and jobs.  But please don't feel that your time at Tapia has not
been a success if you don't walk away with an internship or job.
Not everyone gets one.  And talking to folks about these issues is
still a great learning experience.

**The Career Fair**

It's been some time since I've been to an in-person Tapia Career Fair.  In my
experience, Career Fairs can be madhouses, with students energetically looking
for positions.  Make sure to take time to learn about the places and about
the experiences of people you meet.  And don't just focus on the big
companies; many smaller places can be great places to intern or work.

Be polite and professional.

You should also dress professionally, but not to the extreme.  Tapia is relatively
casual.  For men (or anyone, I suppose), khakis and a polo should be fine.  You'll
see some people dressed better and others dressed more casually.

Make sure to bring copies of your résumé.  Twenty or so copies should suffice.
And upload your résumé to the database.

I must admit that my favorite Tapia Career Fair experience was at
the first Tapia I attended, which I also think was the first time
Tapia had a Career Fair.  A Grinnell student decided that the best
thing for them to do would be to visit each booth and ask how they
handled microaggressions at their company.  In many cases, they
then had to explain what a microaggression is.  Still, I would
not recommend that you do the same.  You can, however, ask about
inclusion initiatives and such.

I also met one of my favorite non-Grinnell colleagues at the first
Tapia Career Fair.  We still chat regularly and they've helped some
Grinnell students find internships and such.  So remember, part of
attending Tapia is making connections.

As I noted above, don't expect to walk away from Tapia with an
internship or job or even a lead on one.  Consider other ways
that you can benefit from the Career Fair.  At the very least,
you get some practice in the job search process.

On that note ... a colleague reminds me that CS Career Fairs often
provide opportunities for conference swag.  Make sure to leave a
bit of room in your suitcase.

Also: The Career Fair is only Wednesday evening and Thursday (all day).
Friday is reserved for interviews with employers.  So plan your time to
visit on Wednesday and Thursday.

**Presentations and Such**

Tapia, like most conferences, has a variety of presentations.  A few presentations
are intended for the whole conference community and have nothing scheduled in 
conflict with them.  Those are held in large auditoriums.  These presentations
include the Fireside Chat on Wednesday evening, the two keynotes on Thursday
morning, and the Ken Kennedy lecture on Friday morning.  I expect you to attend
all of those.  I also expect you to attend the newcomers' session on Wednesday
afternoon and the conference banquet on Friday evening.

The rest of the day, you'll find that Tapia offers multiple simultaneous sessions,
sometimes as many as ten.  There are many kinds of sessions.

* _Talks_ are typically given by one or two speakers on a particular topic.
* _Panels_ typically involve a group of people who discuss a topic, often
  with different viewpoints, with a moderator who manages the discussion.
* _Birds of a Feature_ (BoFs) sessions are intended to be more of a large-group
  discussion.  Usually, anyone who attends can participate.  Don't be nervous,
  though; you are not forced to participate.
* _Workshops_ help you learn new things.
* _Posters_ are what they sound like; students have created posters of their
  work.  They stand by them and discuss their work.  I strongly encourage you
  to attend the posters.  You should also consider submitting a
  poster for next year.  After all, if you get a poster accepted,
  you normally get a scholarship to attend.

Tapia differs from most other conferences in that the foci of the sessions
differ.  At most conferences, sessions are an opportunity to present new
work.  Tapia includes some of that.  But you'll also find sessions that
focus more on diversity issues, including some that reflect personal
stories, as well as sessions that help build skills or knowledge,
such as how to participate in an interview.  I'd encourage you to try out
a variety of kinds of sessions.

Since you won't be able to attend all sessions, you might find it helpful
to partner with another student or students so that you can report back
to each other on what you've learned.

**Other Conference Activities**

The conference also has a variety of breaks and receptions, as well
as some informal meet-ups.  These provide an opportunity to meet
with other people.  The connections you form at Tapia can last for
years; please take the time to meet other people.  I met this year's
Tapia Chair when he was still a student; I recall sitting at a table
and talking for a while, although I don't remember everything we
discussed.  I haven't taken advantage of that connection (at least
I don't think I have), but it's nice having someone I know I can
reach out to about conference issues.

Most of the breaks and receptions have food.  Please plan to eat at them, if
possible.  (We'll talk more about meals and such in a moment.)

**Practical Issues: Required Sessions**

We expect that those funded by STARS and Grinnell will attend
all of the keynotes and other common sessions, as well as the STARS
Celebration.  I'd recommend that everyone attend those sessions.
Here's my approximate list of sessions you should plan to attend,
along with some optional ones.

Wednesday

* Wednesday, 5:15 p.m., Newcomers Orientation Session
* Wednesday, 6:00 p.m., Welcome and Fireside Chat
* Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., Career Fair [Optional]

Thursday

* Thursday, 8:30 a.m., Grinnell Gathering [Optional, location TBD]
* Thursday, 9:00 a.m., Welcome and Announcements
* Thursday, 9:30 a.m., Plenary Keynote 1
* Thursday, 10:15 a.m., Plenary Keynote 2

Friday

* Friday, 8:30 a.m., Grinnell Gathering [Optional, Location TBD]
* Friday, 9:00 a.m., Welcome and Announcements
* Friday, 9:30 a.m., Ken Kennedy Lecture
* Friday, 6:00 p.m., Awards, Banquet, and Dancing (you can leave after dinner)

Saturday

* Saturday, 8:30 a.m. (all day): STARS
* Saturday, Dinnertime, Dinner with Grinnell Alums [Optional, current being planned]

**Practical Issues: Communication**

I've set up an information spreadsheet for all of us to enter information.  Feel 
free to text me if you need something or have a question.

Whova is the primary conference app.  Make sure you get it before the conference.
You should be able to reach people via Whova.

I also expect to set up a WhatsApp or something similar for us to communicate.

**Practical Issues: Transportation**

You should have received the details from our Academic Assistant [7].

Grinnell will transport those it has funded (plus the two STARS
students) to the airport and then back from the airport.  Those 
with Tapia scholarships are, unfortunately, on your own.

_Please be on time for the shuttle.  If you miss the shuttle, you
are on your own to get to/from the airport._  You may want to set
up a buddy system to remind each other to get up in time.  I think
it's at 4:30 a.m. or some similarly painful hour on Wednesday
morning.

When I'm in DC, I generally take public transportation from the airport
to the hotel; it's worked fine for me.  I would encourage you to do
the same.  However, if you are uncomfortable taking public transportation
(and you are funded by Grinnell or STARS), the department will reimburse
you for the cost of an Uber or Lyft or Cab.

**Practical Issues: Money**

For those funded by Grinnell or STARS, our goal is that all your
expenses are covered, including transportation, hotel, registration,
and meals.  You will likely have to pay for some things in DC, such
as meals and transportation.  _Please keep receipts for reimbursement._
I believe the current College limit is $40 per day for meals.  Talk
to me if you have difficulty staying within that limit.  Also, note
that Grinnell will not reimburse for alcohol.

I realize that not all of you may have the resources to pay in advance
and then get reimbursed.  Contact me if you need cash or need me to
Venmo you some money in advance.  As you'd expect, if you borrow money from
me, you have to pay me when you get reimbursed.  You can also choose to
give me your receipts, and I'll turn them in for reimbursement.

**Practical Issues: Hotel Rooms**

You will be sleeping three or four to a hotel room.  I believe most
rooms have two beds.  You can choose how best to divide up sleeping
arrangements, whether it be two to a bed, or one person on the
floor, or whatever.

Please keep your hotel room neat and tidy; put clothes back in
suitcases or in drawers, pick bedding up from the floor, and put
books and such in neat stacks on the desk.  The folks who have to
clean the room will appreciate it.

Speaking of the housekeeping staff, I firmly believe that we should
tip housekeeping staff.  Make sure that one person from your room
gets tip money from me and that you leave some each day.  I tend
to leave it on the bathroom sink in a folded piece of paper that
says "Housekeeping".

_Note: Current COVID protocols may indicate that your room is not
cleaned every day.  If that is the case, we'll just tip on the last
day._

**Practical Issues: COVID**

I recommend that you take a COVID-19 test before you leave Grinnell
(and don't leave if you test positive).

You will be required to take a COVID-19 test before you check in to
the conference.  If you test positive, you will not be permitted to
attend the conference.  We will do our best to make sure that you are
appropriately taken care of at the hotel.

The conference requires masking.  Bring masks.

**Visiting Washington, DC**

I know that many of you are excited to be in Washington, DC.
Unfortunately, we could not leave you a lot of time for visits.  I
believe you currently have some unscheduled time on Wednesday before
the newcomers' session.  You should also be free Thursday after the
end of sessions (5 p.m. or so) and Saturday after the STARS Celebration
(although we will have dinner with alums).

**Other Issues**

Remember that you represent Grinnell.  Please be on good behavior
throughout the conference.

Many people are supporting your trip to Tapia, either financially
or through their work.  Please plan to send them thank-you notes.
(We will probably do a few as a group.)

We will have a small-group debrief when we return which we will then
follow-up with a presentation at CS Table or CS Extras (or both).

**_Postscript_**: Sending students to Tapia (or GHC) is not cheap.
We usually spend about $600 on transportation, $600 on registration,
$400 on hotel, and $200 on other expenses per student.  So please
make good use of the money (and effort) we spend.  And please
consider giving back to the BPC fund when you have an income.

[1] That's a mouthful, isn't it?  I will use "Tapia", "Tapia
2022", or "The Tapia Celebration" for the rest of the musing.

[2] The "half student" graciously agreed to volunteer at the conference to
cover their registration cost.

[3] The restricted fund and the BPC fund come from donations to the department,
most frequently from alums, faculty, and families.

[4] Students should know a bit about this by now, since they've applied for
funding and, in doing so, read about the celebration.

[5] The times I've gone to Hopper, I've appreciated the experience
of being in the minority; I think it helps me support my students
better.

[6] The "theme-ing" of our introductory sequence has also been shown to
help.

[7] Nope, not putting their name in here.
