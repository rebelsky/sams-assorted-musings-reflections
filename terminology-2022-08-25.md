For all of my time at Grinnell, I've worked to broaden participation
in computing.  That is, I consider it part of my professional
responsibilities [1] to help make CS welcoming to people
who have not traditionally become computer scientists and to
encourage such students to pursue CS.  After all, computers are
changing the world for better [2] and for worse [3]; all voices
should play a role in developing the technology that's
having that impact.  Plus, CS is fun [4], and, um, it generally pays
well.

When I write about BPC [5] issues, I often need to refer to the groups
I seek to support and attract.  For a long time, I used "students from groups
traditionally underrepresented in computing".  However, someone smarter than me
pointed out that that phrase puts to onus on those students to represent, rather
than on the discipline to welcome them.

More recently, I've been using "students from groups traditionally underserved in
CS education", or something similar.  That phrase appropriately puts the onus on
CS educators rather than the students.  However, "underserved" is an odd word.
I've also seen it get autocorrected to "undeserved", which is not at all what I
intend.  So I've been looking for other alternatives.

The "people who have not traditionally been computer scientists or
CS majors" is a new phrase I developed for this musing, mostly
because I didn't want to use either of those phrases.  Maybe I
should have stayed away from the topic altogether and focused on
the groups that are served.  I could have written "people other
than White and Asian males" or the longer "people other than those
overrepresented in computing, such as White and Asian males".  I'll
admit that I don't particularly like any of the phrases.  The one
from above is a bit long and focuses on individuals rather than
groups [7].  The latter two almost sound exclusionary.  The last one
is perhaps ambigiuous.  Bleh.

A valued colleague uses "students from groups historically excluded
from computing".  I struggle with that.  The term "excluded" seems
intentional and I would hope that much exclusion was unintentional,
in that we don't make the field welcoming, rather than intentional,
in that we actively discourage students from such groups from
pursuing computing.  Unfortunately, while I believe that Grinnell
CS faculty have always done their best to be inclusive, I've heard
from too many women [8] who were explicitly discouraged from pursuing
jobs in CS, engineering, or even science.  If I recall correctly,
at least one of the keynotes at the last SIGCSE told us of such an
experience.

So maybe I should try it out.

> As a computer science educator, I have a responsibility to develop
structures and curricula that welcome and serve students from groups
historically excluded from computing.

It feels better than I thought it would.  Perhaps I'll use that terminology,
at least for the time being.

Now, I just have to continue to try to live up to that goal.

[1] Perhaps my professional role.

[2] I hope.

[3] Unfortunately, there's a lot of evidence of computing making things worse.

[4] Amazingly fun!  Computing is wicked neat!

[5] Broadening Participation in Computing, in case you didn't understand the TLA [6].

[6] Three-Letter Acronym.

[7] Hmmm ... Perhaps there is a value on focusing on individuals.  I've been told
that I should avoid racial essentialism.  That is, a person is not who they are
racialized as, and so we should not focus on such groups.

[8] Not at Grinnell.
