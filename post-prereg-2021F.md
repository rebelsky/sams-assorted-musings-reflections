In which we continue our exploration of the wonders of registration
at Grinnell.

For those not familiar with the registration process at Grinnell
(or at least the registration process for returning students), it's
a bit different than what you see at most institutions.  Rather
than relying on first-come, first-served, as some institutions do,
or on prioritization by class year, as others do, Grinnell uses a
more complicated, but ultimately fairer system.

Students first "preregister" for classes.  During the preregistration
period, we allow classes to enroll beyond their capacity.  In effect,
preregistration permits students to declare an interest in a class
but does not guarantee them a seat in the class.  There's been a movement
to call this period "open registration"; I'm not sure what the rationale
is for the name change.

In any case, after preregistration, faculty members and department
chairs (who are also faculty members) look at their enrollments and
make changes to the schedule.  When courses are over-enrolled, we
look for ways to handle that over-enrollment.  Strategies include
switching students to another class ("Balancing"), removing a subset
of the class, perhaps randomly, perhaps with a prioritization system
("Cutting"), or finding a way to add another section, perhaps by
cutting another class, perhaps by finding another faculty member
to teach the class [1] and negotiating with the Dean to pay for
that extra class.  We also close classes that are full (or, in some
cases, nearly full).  We call that process, "Cut, Close, and Balance".
I tend to refer to it as CCB.

Preregistration finished on Friday, April 23rd.  Our Cut, Close,
and Balances (or policies for cuts, closes, and balances) were due
to the the Registrar's office on Friday, April 30th.  I took a look
on the morning of Tuesday, May 4, and it looked like I believe the
amazing staff of Registrar's office was still frantically working
on them.  Or at least I still saw some over-enrolled courses.

I'm sad.  My muse thought I should write about the topic today [2].
Oh well.  At least I started.

_Time passes._

_And passes._

Now that the process is done, I can see what's happened.  I expect
that my comments will at least partially mirror [what I wrote at
the end of preregistration](prereg-2021F)

## Computer science

You may recall that we had too few slots left in CSC-151,
_Functional Problem Solving_, to accommodate the expected demand
from incoming students.  We had to cut.  We ended up cutting anyone
in their third or fourth years [3].  I don't like doing that, but
second-years should have priority.  Perhaps the incoming first-year
students won't claim the slots.  Perhaps we'll have some spring
slots; we usually do.  In any case, we have 44 slots available
across the three sections, which suggests we left 28 students
enrolled, slightly more than our target of 24.

The two sections of CSC-161, _Imperative Problem Solving_, are
balanced, with three total slots remaining.  The two sections of
CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and
Algorithms_, are also balanced, but with only one slot remaining.
I wonder how many of those students will become CS majors?  I think
that historically, about 2/3 of the students who take CSC-207 become
CS majors.

There are still two slots left in CSC-213-02, _Operating Systems_,
and three left in CSC-301-02, _Analysis of Algorithms_.  Those are
the only slots left in our upper-level required courses for the major
[4].  Since we had to cut a lot of students from CSC-324, _Software
Design and Development_, and CSC-341, _Automata, Formal Languages,
and Computational Complexity_ [5].  For the first time in my memory,
we had to cut seniors from the latter two courses.  It makes me sad.
But we'll have two sections of CSC-341 in the spring and two of
CSC-324, so seniors will be able to graduate with their CS majors.

I'll say that it took about an hour in a department meeting to agree
upon general policies for cuts as well as some more discussions to
firm up some concerns (e.g., majors going abroad or trying to
graduate in seven semesters; students in other majors counting on
CS courses as part of those majors).  Then Jerod spent a few hours
working everything out.  I'm so appreciative of that work; I don't
think I could have handled the stress of cutting students nor of the
follow-up emails that he likely received.

## Other significantly over-enrolled courses

CLS-255-01, _History of Ancient Greece_, remains over-enrolled by
two students, rather than fourteen.  I wonder why Monessa Cummins [6]
didn't cut the last two.  In contrast, ENV-145-01, _Nations and the
Global Environment_,  Carolyn Lewis cut fifty! students from HIS-195,
_ST: Comparative Herbalism_.  I assume that was a random cut.  Abram 
Lewis followed the same model as MC and kept seventeen in GWS-395, 
rather than cutting to its cap of fifteen.  I wonder what leads folks to
make those decisions.  I suppose it's something like "keep all the
seniors".

GWS may just be particularly generous.  GWS-195-01, _ST: Sexwork in the
City_, is now over-enrolled by four, down from an over-enrollment of
fourteen.  GWS-295-01, remains over-enrolled by three.

## The alphabetical list

I'm not sure that there's a lot interesting here, but I'll give it a try.

ANT-210, _Illness, Healing, and Culture_.  This course had been
over-enrolled by thirty students.  Now there's a second section.
It looks like they were able to serve sixteen students in the second
section; not everyone can switch to a new time.  I assume a few
others will rearrange their schedule to enroll in the second section.
How did they free a section?  It looks like they canceled a section of
ANT-104.  It looks like there are still 37 slots in ANT-104 for
incoming first-year students.

Three sections of ART-111, _Introduction to the Studio_, had been
over-enrolled by twenty-seven students with four slots in the fourth
section.  There are now thirteen available slots for incoming
first-years across the four sections.  I assume Studio Art followed
a policy somewhat like CS, cutting some students to make room for
first-years.  As I've said before, we need more sections of Studio
Art, which means we need more Studio faculty.  I guess we've added
one [7], but their work is in film, and they are building our film
and media studies program.

On the subject of Studio Art, it looks like ART-236, _Print Media_, and 
ART-242, _Sculpture_, have been cut to capacity.  ART-238, _Painting_,
ART-255, _Fundamentals of Video Production_, and ART-315, _Adv Studio:
Contemporary Practices_, all are slightly over-enrolled.

BIO-251, _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms_ [8] was severely imbalanced.
It looks like it's much more balanced.  One section is over-enrolled
by one, but that's not bad.

The 300-level Bio classes remain over-enrolled but less so.  I wonder
how Bio decides who to cut.  In any case, BIO-325, _Fungal Biology_,
has 14/12, BIO-343, _Comparative Vertebrate Morphology_, has 16/12,
BIO-365, _Microbiology_, has 14/12, BIO-368, _Ecology_, has 14/12,
and BIO-380, _Molecular Biology_, has 22.

Like its friend BIO-251, CHM-221, _Organic Chemistry I_, has been
balanced.  It looks like the balancing wasn't perfect.  One section
remains over-enrolled by three students and another by six.  There
are three slots open in section 2; perhaps 10:00 a.m. MWF is a bad
time.

On the subject of Chemistry, CHM-363, _Physical Chemistry I_, is
now over-enrolled by six students.  But they've added a third section
of lab.  The three labs have room for six more students.  I wonder
why they didn't over-enroll by twelve.  Well, there is the issue
that it's horrible to have a class of thirty-six students.  But is
thirty-six that much different than thirty?  I'm not sure.

EDU-101 appears to have been balanced.  I wonder if one person got
cut in the balancing.  That's what my prior count was.  I'd hate to
make the decision to cut just one person.

Hmmm ... How did I miss the over-enrolled English courses last time
through?  Twenty-two students got cut from ENG-205, _The Craft of
Fiction_.  Ouch.  Another six got cut from ENG-206, _The Craft of
Poetry_.  Five were cut from ENG-337, _The British Novel I_.  It looks
like there's room in other 300-level English classes for those students.

History had a lot of cutting to do.  HIS-266-01, _History of the
Modern Middle East_, is down to its cap of 25.  HIS-284-01, _Surveillance
Modern History_, is still three over its cap, at 28.  That's better
than 45!  I wonder if History surveilled students to decide who should
be kept in the course.

MAT-316, _Foundations of Analysis_, went from one over-enrolled
section of thirty-two to two reasonable sections of sixteen.  How
did they make room for an extra section?  Let's see if I can figure
it out.  One section of MAT-133, _Calculus II_ was canceled.  Royce
Wolf was teaching that section.  Royce is now teaching one of the
two sections of MAT-131, _Calculus I_, which frees Mark Chamberland
to teach two sections of Analysis.  That wasn't so complicated.
But it does mean that Royce has three different preps.  While I
know that Royce has taught all three courses many times, that still
doesn't seem all that fair.

PCS-101-01, _Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies_, had been
over-enrolled by twenty-seven students [9].  Now there are four slots
available, presumably for first-year students [10].  I wonder what
policies got used for cutting.

PHI-111, _Introduction to Philosophy_, had been over-enrolled by six
students between the two sections.  There are now eight slots available
between the two sections.  That's not a lot for the incoming first-year
students.  Once again, I wonder what categories got cut.

Peter Hanson's over-enrolled Political Sciences courses are now at
capacity.  Let's hope those students can find other courses of
interest.

PSY-246, _Brain and Behavior_ [11], is at capacity.

SOC-240, _Social Movements_, is now overenrolled by only one, rather
than ten.  My mind recalled SOC-295-02, _American Paganisms_, as
also being over-enrolled, but it was not.

## Slightly over-enrolled courses

It looks like a variety of folks allowed a few extra students to stay
in their classes.  Here's the list.

* ANT-221-01, _Primate Behavior and Taxonomy_ [12], is at 22/20.
* ANT/SOC-291-01, _Methods of Empirical Investigation_ [14], is at 19/18. 
  The vast majority of those students seem to be enrolled in SOC-291.
* CHM-210-01, _Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry_ is at 27/24.
* EAS-195-01, _EAS Gateway Food East Asia_ is still at 26/25.  And I
  still think our new Associate Dean shouldn't be teaching in a year
  in which there will be a lot of hiring.  Is it any wonder that
  1/3 of our high-level administrators feel overworked?
* MAT-321-01, _Foundations of Abstract Algebra_, remains over-enrolled
  by two students.  I'm surprised that Math didn't ask two of the
  students to switch to the newly-opened slots in MAT-316.
* NRS-495-01, _Neuroscience Seminar_, is at 16/15.
* PHI-257-01, _Philosophy of Science_, is at 24/22.  I'm a bit
  surprised because I have it listed as 23/22 toward the end of
  prereg [15]
* POL-352-01, _US Foreign Policymaking Process_, is at 19/15.
* PSY-225-01, _Research Methods_, is at 28/25.  I assume Psych can't
  easily cut students from the methods course.

## Other notes

I hadn't realized it before, but it doesn't look like Anthropology has
any 300-level classes this fall.  I wonder why not.  I suppose
Anthro has a different approach to 300-level classes than we do.
Sociology has three 300-level courses, but two of them are special
topics.  Now I want to look at how departments distribute course
numbers.  But that's a musing for another day.

I suppose I should also see how my advisees fared.  A few of them
have checked for themselves and sent me notes.  But not everyone
is as responsible as those few.  That's what's up next.

Or maybe I should edit this musing.  Nah.  It's good enough.
