In which we continue our exploration of the wonders of registration at Grinnell.

For those not familiar with the registration process at Grinnell
(or at least the registration process for returning students), it's
a bit different than what you see at most institutions.  Rather
than relying on first-come, first-served, as some institutions do,
or on prioritization by class year, as others do, Grinnell uses a
more complicated, but ultimately fairer system.

Students first "preregister" for classes.  During preregistration
period, we allow classes to enroll beyond their capacity.  In effect,
preregistration permits students to declare an interest in a class
but does not guarantee them a seat in the class.  There's been a movement
to call this period "open registration"; I'm not sure what the rationale
is for othe name change.

In any case, after preregistration, faculty members and department
chairs (who are also faculty members) look at their enrollments and
make changes to the schedule.  When courses are over-enrolled, we
look for ways to handle that over-enrollment.  Strategies include
switching students to another class ("Balancing"), removing a subset
of the class, perhaps randomly, perhaps with a prioritization system
("Cutting"), or finding a way to add another section, perhaps by
cutting another class, perhaps by finding another faculty member
to teach the class [1] and negotiating with the Dean to pay for
that extra class.  We also close classes that are full (or, in some
cases, nearly full).  We call that process, "Cut, Close, and Balance".
I tend to refer to it as CCB.

Preregistration finished on Friday, April 23rd.  Our Cut, Close,
and Balances (or policies for cuts, closes, and balances) were due
to the Registrar's office on Friday, April 30th.  I took a look on
the morning of Tuesday, May 4, and it looked like I believe the
amazing staff of Registrar's office was still frantically working
on them.  Or at least I still saw some over-enrolled courses.

I'm sad.  My muse thought I should write about the topic today [2].
Oh well.  At least I started.
