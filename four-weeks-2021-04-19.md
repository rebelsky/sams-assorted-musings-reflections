It's now four weeks since my heart attack.  I figured my friends (and
others who read my musings) deserved another update on my status.

Let's start with my health.  I saw my cardiologist [1] a week and a
half ago.  She said all seems to be good.  My cardiac output is
normal [2].  She doesn't think that there was any permanent damage
to my heart.  I tried to convince her that my students say that I'm
heartless, so it wouldn't matter, but she didn't believe me.

However, she did fully suggest that I have to work less.  My therapist
did, too.  And my family has been telling me that for years.  So,
I'm working more on working less, if that makes sense.  More on that
issue to follow.

I'm exercising almost daily.  Much of it happens during cardiac rehab,
but I'm also taking walks on my own or with my family.  Soon I'll have
the stamina to take walks with the many folks who offered to walk with
me [3].  My one worry is that my joints are not all that happy with all 
this walking, which is one of the reasons I hadn't been walking regularly.
So I may be staying with the elliptical for a bit longer.

What else?  My blood pressure is good; usually about 120/80 or
110/80.  My 02sat is in the high 90's.  My resting pulse
rate is in the 60s.  All those are good signs.  Of course, I'm on
medicine to help everything be in those places, but the medicine is
working.

That sounds like enough physical health for now.  What about mental health?

It's been strange.  No, that's not the right thing to say.  It's
been good.  After I finish dinner, I usually have to decide which
of a huge list is the highest priority.  Right now, I'm just focusing
on my classes and my wellness.  That means that after dinner, I can
say things like "I think I'll take a walk" or "I think I'll read a
book".  Deciding to take a walk or read a book or watch a TV show
or muse doesn't mean that I'm deciding not to do something that I
have to do, for whatever reason.

I've started having the first "happy for no reason" [4] days I've
had in a long, long time.  Usually, happiness comes from something
nice, like spending time with family [5].  But those days I just
felt good.  It took a while to figure out why.  And then I realized
that I don't have those continuous worries in the back of my head;
they aren't my responsibility anymore.

What will we do with the likely over-enrollments in our fall courses?
I don't care; it's someone else's responsibility [6].

What will we do next spring, when we still have too few faculty to
advise our majors?  I don't care, it's someone else's responsibility.

What happens if we go far over sixty majors this year, and we only
have offerings for sixty [8]?  I don't care, it's someone else's
responsibility.

Are we going to be able to offer our two-credit courses again?  If
not, how do we continue offering an appropriate range of topics for
our students?  I don't care, it's someone else's responsibility.

I suppose "I don't care" is the wrong phrase.  "I can't care" or
"I shouldn't care" would be better.  If I cared about these things
as much as I did before, my stress level would be high, my blood
pressure would go up, and my health would suffer.  I didn't put us
in this position, other than by trying to build a strong department.
I've asked enough for help to get us out of these situations.  But
you know what? It can't be just my responsibility or even the CS
department's communal responsibility; the institution should be
taking some of the lead in addressing these kinds of problems.

What about those dozen or so important topics that the department
is supposed to discuss, from formalizing our procedures and practices,
to issues of diversity, to learning outcomes for some core courses,
to long-term planning, to assessment, to other things I no longer
remember?  I may participate in the discussions, if it doesn't add
too much stress to my life, but it can't be my responsibility to
lead them nor to do the necessary preparation or follow-up work.

Should I be upset at failures of shared governance, about promises
not kept, about disconnects between what we say we value and what
we do, about a valued colleague who is giving up on raising important
issues, about the host of things that usually upset me?  Nope;
although I have no designated successors for these things, I need
not be the one to worry [9].  And I'm not going to muse or rant
about them anymore [10].  As this paragraph suggests, I'm still a
curmudgeon, but I'm trying to be less of one.

Anyway, it feels nice not to worry about work.  I'm hoping I can
remain moderately worry-free.  Last week, I was upset about the
administrator who was rude and then ghosted me [11]; this week,
I'm not so worried, except that I'm wondering whether I can refuse
to deal with them ever again.  Oh well; that's an issue for next year.

What about that argument with someone I highly respect?  I feel bad
for arguing with them; we're meeting tomorrow and I hope we can
patch things up.  But that argument reminded me that I take things
too seriously, and when I take things too seriously, it affects my
health.  So I'm trying to stop.

I finally got the grading done for my Spring Term One class [12].
I felt guilty about how long it took, but I needed the time.  And
I couldn't have done it without my **incredibly fantastic junior
colleagues**, who took on much of the load.  It feels good to have
that off my plate.  Over the longer term, I need to find ways to
cut down on grading [14,15].

Well, that's enough about my mental state and workload.  What else?

I've cut way down on salt and fats, which feels good conceptually,
even though I miss cooking with salt [16].  I eat about three or
four servings of veggies and five or so servings of fruit each day.
But I need to move from eating right to eating less.  I've lost
fifteen pounds or so since the heart attack, but I'd say close to
ten of that was just water weight or fluid buildup from a failing
heart.  In any case, losing a pound or two a week isn't a bad plan.

I hate being on blood thinners.  I'm used to getting small nicks
while gardening or cleaning or whatever.  Now I bleed profusely
when it happens.  I don't get bothered by the sight of blood, but
I do get irritated with the necessary cleanup, and I don't want to
scare people.  So I'm trying to carry around enough bandages to
handle those situations.

I'm more tired than I'd expect.  I seem to need at least ten hours
of sleep per night.  Of course, it felt like I needed ten hours of
sleep before I had the heart attack; I was just less good at giving
myself that much time to sleep.  And I'm not always sleeping well;
I'm not sure why.  But I think these things will get better, too.

In the end, I think I'm doing the right things, at least so far.
I'm exercising.  I'm watching my diet.  I'm paying attention to
stress.  I'm saying no to things.  I'm taking more time for myself.
I know that I need to step back even more from my non-teaching work.
Doing so will reduce stress, give me time to spend on relaxation
and wellness, and help me get and stay healthier.

But I'm making progress on that end, too.  I'm not worrying about
big new projects.  For example, I was considering putting together
a group to draft an NSF proposal on equitable grading.  I'm not
going to worry about that any more.

I think that the TL;DR is supposed to come at the start, rather than
the end.  But I think I'll put it here.  It's a conversation I've had
a few times lately.

_How are you Sam?_

I'm alive.  I'm great.

**_Postscript_**: I'll post another follow-up musing in a few weeks.
Feel free to drop me an email if you want to know how I'm doing.

[1] Well, she's a Nurse Practitioner in Cardiology.  I think that
still qualifies her as a Cardiologist.

[2] I've mentioned that before.

[3] It's fine if you want to withdraw that offer or add that offer.

[4] Other than "I'm alive".

[5] Okay, it's almost always "spending time with family".

[6] I did get to participate in our conceptual discussions of
prioritization [7] today.  Leading that discussion and carrying out
those rules would have placed me under undue stress.

[7] E.g., which group gets cut first from each category of class.

[8] Three sections of CSC-301 can serve 60 students.  Three sections
of CSC-341 can serve 60 students.  Four sections of CSC-324 can
serve 64 students, which is a bit better.  Two sections of CSC-213
and two sections of CSC-211 can serve twenty-four students who want
to take one of those courses and thirty-six who want to take both.
I guess that last pairing is one place we have some slack.

[9] Sorry, Michelle.  You were right.  I should have listened earlier.

[10] Well, maybe once in a while.  But if I don't muse about them, I
don't need to think about them.

[11] My therapist suggests that it's not the particular situation, but
the broader issues it represents.  He's right.  I'm trying not to be
upset about the broader issues, either.

[12] A week ago.

[14] Escaping from the horror of terms will help.

[15] Of course, I've been trying to find ways to cut down on grading for
decades.

[16] Throw the fresh broccoli in the steamer.  Sprinkle salt on top.
Cook until done.  It's so straightforward and tastes so good.  And that
holds for so many other things I make with fresh vegetables.
