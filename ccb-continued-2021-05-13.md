A few days ago, I reflected on [the broad changes wrought by the
Fall 2021 Cut, Close, and Balance period](post-prereg-2021F).  I ended
the musing by noting that I had to check on my advisees, including the
two who had already written to me.

In addition to the five students graduating this term, who should
not need courses, I have twenty-four returning advisees [1].  I'm
not completely sure of their distribution because of the effects
of leaves, but I think I have ten in the class of 2022, five in the
class of 2023, and nine in the class of 2024 [2].  One in the class
of 2022 is taking a semester off to pursue an internship.  Of the
nine Tutorial students, four were cut from a course.  Of the five
in the class of 2023, four were cut from one or two courses.  Of
the nine registering the class of 2022, only two were cut from a
course.  Ten out of twenty-three were cut; about 45%.  I wonder if
that's normal.

I also wonder if it's normal that those in the class of 2023 suffer
the brunt of cuts.  Two of the four were CS majors hoping to take
two CS courses in the Fall who were cut to one course.  Handling
over-enrollments in CSC-324 and CSC-341 was a bear.  And we did
prioritize seniors over third-years [3].  The other two were cut
from severely over-enrolled courses: Intro Studio and History of
Education.  Oh, that's right, one was cut from two courses, CS
and Peace and Conflict Studies.  It's awful to be cut from two
courses [4].

What else were my advisees cut from?  Two were cut from _Peace and
Conflict Studies_, a rising second-year student and a rising
third-year.  I wonder who gets prioritized for that course.  Or
maybe it's random.  I'm not sure what one got cut from; we'd talked
about so many courses that it's hard to remember.  Of course, that
one has already found another course.  One got cut from _The Craft
of Fiction_.  I keep wondering why we don't offer more sections of
that course.  A few got cut from Studio Art courses.  A few managed
to stay in their Studio Art courses.  One got cut from _History of
Ancient Greece_A few got cut from CSC-324 (I think).  One may have
been cut from CSC-341.

In any case, it looks like most of the cuts happened in the
over-enrolled courses.  I don't recall giving the normal warnings
about those classes.  And I certainly didn't expect the level of
cuts we had to do in CS.

Cuts are painful.  But are they more painful than being prevented
from registering for a course in the first place?  I'm not sure.
As I've said before, although I agree that our registration system
is complicated, I haven't heard suggestions for a better one [5].
However, I do wonder whether we could be more of a data-driven
institution, as President Kington suggested when he started.  For
example, if we required students to fill out four-year plans in
Self Service, rather than on paper, we could learn more about
predicted demand.  Student choices change [6], but having a general
sense of what they plan might help.

Oh well, I'm fortunate to have a new motto.  "It's not my responsibility."

[1] I've been told that the College average is twelve, which seems
to make sense given our 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio and the approximately
1/3 of Grinnellians who double major.

[2] Tutorials normally have twelve students.  This year, Tutorial numbers
were often down.  Two of my Tutorial students decided to take a gap year
and one decided to transfer.

[3] Should "third-years" be hyphenated?  Grammarly says so, but I don't
know a good rule for it.  "Third-year students" should be, but that's not
at issue here.

[4] Of course, I'm pretty sure that we cut some students from two
courses, such as non-majors trying to enroll in two upper-level courses.

[5] Neither "priority by class year" nor "first-come, first-served"
is better.  A bidding system might be, at least if we could be sure
that all students knew how to manipulate the system.  But that's
doubtful.  Maybe a round-based priority by class year system.  (E.g.,
all seniors pick one course, then all third-year students, then all
second-years, then all first-years, then we loop back to the seniors
again.)  But that sounds painful to manage.

[6] Unsurprisingly.
