* The Hidden Curriculum
* Revisiting 151 - Some folks want more lecture.  Many want more time for
  labs.  So ... Expand to two hours?  Teach fewer topics in more depth?
  Make them do lab outside of class?

Revisiting 151

Pair Programming is the best, people who think otherwise are naive or dumb. You helped me believe in myself even though most of the time I am struggling. Even though CSC-151 is probably one of the hardest classes I have ever taken, I would do it all over again, which is surprising for me to say since I am usually "one-and-done" when it comes to schoolwork. You are one of the best teachers I have had.

Some worries about my tangents.

Teams

??? There was not enough collaboration besides discussions during class.

vs.

The class is mostly lab-based and discussion-based so there are many chances to work with and get to know your classmates. Everyone is smart and respectful and willing to learn, and each person has different approaches to solving the same problem which is really fun.

Less reading and more assignments would have worked better for me personally, we had like 3 assignments [???: six assignments, 28 LAs]

Word clouds: "miniscule" is actually from "mini-project".  "problematic" comes
from "problem".
