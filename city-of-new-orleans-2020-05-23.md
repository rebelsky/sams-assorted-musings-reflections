Like many people of my generation, I love the song "City of New Orleans"
by Steve Goodman.  And like many people of my generation who don't live
in the Windy, No-Longer-Second City, I know it primarily (or at least
originally) through Arlo Guthrie's cover version.

I will admit that I have difficulty identifying what I like about
any song [1].  For "City of New Orleans", I certainly like the
melody; it's a song you can sing along to [3,4].  But it's much more
than that.  Part of it is the framing of the song: It's a train song
(popular in the U.S.), it's even a nostalgic train song, but it
also makes it explicit that it's nostalgic and that the age of the
passenger train as a primary mode of transportation has reached its
end ("and the steel rail still ain't heard the news", "this train's
got the disappearing railroad blues").

Perhaps more than that, I appreciate his observations and they way he
turns them into carefully framed lyrics, "the sons of Coleman Porters
and the sons of engineers ride their fathers' magic carpet made of
steel", which is a wonderful pairing, or "pass the paper bag that
holds the bottle", which is so much better than the more obvious
"pass the bottle" or "pass the booze".

The other day, I was reading about the song on the Interweb.  It was
the result of one of those traditional labyrinthian Interweb paths.  I'd
been reading about John Prine, who passed away recently.  Prine regularly
played with Goodman [5].  That led me to read a bit about Goodman and
one of his most famous songs [6].

And I discovered something interesting.  There are versions of "City
of New Orleans" in other languages.  Now, these are not your
traditional cover versions, such as the Beatles' "[Komm, gib mir
deine Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qAazPVLONM)" [7,9],
which approximately translate the lyrics into the other the language.
Instead, these retain the melody, but discard essentially everything
else.

We'll start with Gerard Cox's 1973 Dutch [11] version, "['t Is Weer
Voorbij Die Mooie Zomer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23ORU2CZ5K4)".
(You can read the lyrics and an approximate translation at the end
of this musing.)_ I'm not quite sure how to describe Cox's version
[12].  It has nothing to do with trains.  It's about summer.  Here
are a few of the lyrics, translated.

> We played golf and jeu de boule  
> We were happy in a chair  
> That summer started in May  

Such close attention to detail, isn't it?  Cox does echo the
nostalgia of Goodman's song, but Goodman's is a nostalgia that
admits it's nostalgic and that nostalgia is potentially problematic.
Cox's also notes some concerns, such as in the chorus.

> It's over that beautiful summer again  
> That summer started in May  
> Ah, you thought there was no end to it  
> But before you know it, it's all that summer long gone

The summer ends, but it's coming again, at least in my reading of
the song.  Maybe it's more meaningful in Dutch.  I do wish I knew
more of the cultural context, since there are at least two lyrics
that feel a bit pointed to me.

> Van haring geur vermengd met zonnebrand (*Herring fragrance mixed with sunscreen*)

> De ochtend vol van vogelzang (*The morning full of bird song*)  
> Het scherpe, hoge zoemen van een mug (*The sharp, high buzzing of a mosquito*)

At least in the English translation, that's doesn't bit like Goodman's
lyrics do, but it adds some interest to a song that feels sentimentally
trite.

Oh, did I mention?  There's a group of background singers who start
and end the song with a long sequence of "Na"s [14].  They transform
the folkie song to, well, mediocre pop, at least in my world.  They
also sing "oohs" on many of the verses.  I know those aren't in the
Goodman original, but there's something like it in the Guthrie
version.  Does Guthrie's version use a pedal steel or a choir?  Can
you believe my ears are not good enough to tell?  I think it's a
pedal steel.  I'll need to ask one of my family members.  They all
say it's backing singers.  So much for my ability to parse sounds
[17].

---

Next up is a French version by Joe Dassin, "[Salut les
amoureux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEyV7_eNBs)".  And yes,
I've put the lyrics at the end.  Dassin, who I think inspired
Cox, has a much folkier version.  But it's folky in the same way
as the Guthrie version is and the Goodman version is (at least on
the _Steve Goodman_ album), there are still backing  vocalists singing
along during the chorus and doing "oohs" during some verses.  

What's the subject?  Let's check the first four lines of an English
translation by a noted poetic translator [18].

> The mornings follow each other and look alike  
> When love gives way to everyday life  
> We weren't made to live together  
> It's not always enough to love each other well

That's right.  It's a breakup song.  I find it more poetic than "'t
Is Weer Voorbij Die Mooie Zomer" but perhaps that's because it's
in French.  Or, upon re-reading the lyrics, it's a standard pop
romance song.  I'm not sure.  In any case, I find it a strange
adaption of "City of New Orleans" as it lacks the original's broader
societal commentary.

The Joe Dassin version appears to have been relatively popular or
at least popular enough to spawn a variety of cover versions.  I'm
amused to see what seems to be a non-satiric [Dance floor
version](https://www.amazon.fr/Salut-amoureux-RMX-kizomba-2017/dp/B07KZX1QJ8/),
[a fairly generic instrumental
version](https://www.amazon.fr/Salut-les-amoureux-Instrumental/dp/B07KFPBDJV/)
and some more interesting instrumentals, including [accordion](https://www.amazon.fr/Salut-Les-Amoureux/dp/B08739MQXB/), 
[marching-band](https://www.amazon.fr/Salut-les-amoureux/dp/B012UAHEVA/).
Shouldn't those last few be considered instrumental versions of
"City of New Orleans" rather than "Salut Les Amoureux"?  There's no reason
Steve Goodman's estate should be splitting royalties on instrumentals
with Dassin's.

You might think we would be done with two non-covers.  But we're
not.  There's also a Hebrew-language version entitled "[Shalom Laj
Eretz Nehederet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDLmJdxpktA)"
performed by Hehoram Gaon [19].  How does this one open?
The [first translation I
found](http://www.hebrewsongs.com/song-shalomlacheretznehederet.htm)
says

> I was in Paris and also in Rome,  
> I saw the seven wonders of the world,  
> At the North Pole and also at the South,  
> But there's no place like the Land of Israel.

Yes, that's right, it's a tribute to Israel!  From trains to summers to
breakups to a country; so many places for a song to travel!  This version
is perhaps furthest from the original.  Unless I'm mistaken, there's none
of the sadness that is present in the other three versions.  I suppose
you could say that the "Lot's wife looking towards Sodom" line inspires
some sadness, or at least puzzlement, but I expect that it just refers
to what the Interwebknowldgebase tells me is a pillar of salt which
people call "Lot's wife".

And yes, this version has inspired its own covers.  [My
favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNdN5Ss69Jc) is by the
rock band [Sheygets](https://sheygets.bandcamp.com/) (or perhaps
Shaygetz).  Not as punky as [the version of "City of New Orleans"
by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM1MJkAigbs),
but a good, rockin', interpretation, one that I prefer.  I also
appreciate that there's [a men's choir cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eztWllaR5w) with a young man singing lead.  So many ways in which the
song travels!

---

When I started this musing, I had only identified these three
non-covers of "City of New Orleans".  It turns out that there are
at least two more.  The Dutch version inspired a similar German
version, which I'm going to ignore.  There's also a newer Norwegian
version by Vazelina Bilopphøggers entitled "[Hei, gamle
Valdresfjell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrcMgKgNUHs)".  We
seem to be back to trains.  But there's also something about
cross-country skiing.  I suppose regret for the loss of passenger
trains seems less appropriate for that part of the world, but I
must admit that I am enough of a traditional 'murcan that I don't
know well enough about the status of trains.  When last I visited
Europe, they still seemed fairly central.  Ah, perhaps that's why the
song did not translate naturally.

Even this version has cover versions, including [one with folks at a
school and an actor of sorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrcMgKgNUHs).
Someone also used it as a [demo of their singing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPrYtgNRTzw).

As is too often the case in "Lost in the Interweb" musings, writing
the musing got me further lost in the Interweb.  For example, I was
listening to [the Steve Goodman _Easter Tapes_
version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI6u3IeypR0) [20] and
found that the lyrics about the old men in the club car were
different.  Here's what Goodman sang (starting at about 1:55).

> Now I was dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.  
> Penny a point ain't nobody keepin' score.  
> Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle.  
> Feel the wheels grumblin' beneath the floor.

The "nobody" was not the "no one" I recalled.  So I checked the
[Arlo Guthrie version I'm most familiar
with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvMS_ykiLiQ). Here's what
Guthrie sang (startin at about 1:25).  You'll notice some differences,
which I'm too lazy to highlight.

> Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car.  
> Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.  
> Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle.  
> Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.

I feel like Guthrie's "no one" scans better than Goodman's "nobody"
but that may be because Guthrie's is the one I know better.  The
conversion of "beneath" to "'neath" seems natural.  Neither
it is as big a change as, say, going from "Stoneman's
cavalry" to "So much cavalry" [21].  But there are other changes,
changes that change meaning.  The Goodman version puts him in the
card game; the Guthrie version leaves it ambiguous.  The Goodman
version personifies the wheels; the Guthrie version does not.  Strange.

Of course, the Easter Tapes version is not the first one Goodman
released.  That honor belongs to the one on the _Steve Goodman_
album.  What lyrics appear on that one?  Let's see.

...

One of the many wonders of the Interwebhole is that you can find
all sorts of things, such as one of Goodman's live performances
from August 28, 1971 in Schwenksville, PA [22].  Those lyrics are
a bit different.

> I was shootin' craps with the old men in the club car.  
> Nine's my point and nobody keepin' score.  
> Won't you pass me the paper bag that holds the tequila.  
> You can feel the wheels grumbling [23] beneath the floor.

Other lyrics change, too.  For example,

> The sons of Coleman porters.  The sons of engineers.
> They ride their daddies' magic carpet.  It's made of steel.

He also adds "Hell" before the "Don't ya know me?"

That gets me wondering.  Were the lyrics evolving at that point or
was he just modifying them for the folks in Schwenksville?  I
can't find an earlier performance of the song.  I can't even find
others from before the album release.  Perhaps I need to listen to
post-release performances.

As I said (perhaps not in this musing), it's easy to get lost in the
Interweb.  Or at least it's easy for *me* to get lost in the Interweb.

Neither Google nor Musixmatch seem to have a translation for the

semblance of an understanding of the English equivalents.  Speakers of
Norwegian should feel free to provide corrections.

[1] Maybe I should have taken a music course, such as the legendary
"Clap for Credit" [2].

[2] I don't believe this course is offered at Grinnell, so I don't
have the same ease of access I might have had as an undergrad, presuming,
of course, that I had the opportunity as an undergrad.

[3] As long as you can sing.

[4] "a song to which you can sing along", for *those people*.

[5] Did Goodman help Prine get started?  I don't recall, and I don't
want to get trapped in the Interweb again.

[6] To folks in the aforementioned City by the Lake, "A Dying Cub Fan's
Last Request" or "Go, Cubs, Go" may be more famous.

[7] Like many YouTube links, that one will likely have disappeared by the
time you folow it [8].

[8] You should assume that I've made the same comment about all of the
other links in this musing.

[9] I realize that other-language covers are done by other artists.
But the Beatles' German-language cover of their own song is the one
that comes most readily to mind.  I'm a lazy writer or at least a
lazy muser [10].

[10] Sorry Ralph.

[11] Ich kann kehn Nederlandsche sprechen, or something like that.

[12] I said that already, didn't I?

[14] These "Na"s are nothing like those in Wilson Pickett's "Land
of a 1000 Dances" [15].

[15] You can substitute your favorite version, perhaps Cannibal and
the Headhunters'?  I believe they were the ones who added the "Na"s
to the original by Chris Kenner [16].

[16] I suppose that's another Interwebhole.

[17] I can't describe music.  I can't analyze sounds.  Why am I writing
this musing?

[18] Google.

[19] Google tells me that it was written by Ilan Goldhirsch.

[20] _The Easter Tapes_ is a collection of recordings of Steve
Goodman on the Vin Scelsa show.  It appears that Goodman regularly
showed up there on Easter Sundays.

[21] Perhaps three readers will know the change to which I refer.

[22] I'll leave it to your search skills to find it.

[23] I'd swear he says "drumbling", but my family insist it's
"grumbling".  "Drumble" is a word, meaning to drone or to blather.

[24] Strangely enough, neither the lyrics nor the translation match
completely.

[25] The "ooh"s (however they are spelled) are not in the Musixmatch
version.  I think they are supposed to represent what the background
singers are saying.

[26] No, I did not count the "Na"s to see if they matched.
