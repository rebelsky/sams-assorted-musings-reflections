For as long as I've been at Grinnell, we've had an odd mismatch between how we run fall semester and how we run spring semester. In the fall, we have about seven weeks before the mid-semester break and about seven weeks after. It's not quite seven weeks after fall break because of Thanksgiving, but it's close. However, in the spring, we had eight weeks before the mid-semester break and six weeks after. I'm not sure why. I'm sure someone knows, but I haven't heard. The two hypotheses I recall hearing are either (a) we tried to schedule Grinnell's spring break to overlap with the local school district's spring break or (b) we tried to make sure that Grinnell's spring break overlapped with Easter.

In any case, the 8/6 split was weird. And, at least in recent years, our spring break didn't overlap with the local school district's spring break, which makes things hard for faculty and staff who are also parents of school-age children. So last year, the faculty voted to move spring break forward a week. Now we have about seven weeks before spring break [1] and about seven weeks after spring break. Yay! And our spring break is still usually two weeks long. Yay! Yay! [2]

However, there have been some unexpected effects of these changes. Or perhaps they are simply effects that _I_ did not expect. One has to do with choosing summer research students. This spring, student MAP/299 applications for students in the sciences [3] are due on Friday, February 28 [5], faculty are making their decisions by Friday, March 7, and we're notifying students on Monday, March 10. But March 10 is during spring break. How will that work? I guess we'll see.

From my perspective, the more problematic effects have been on my advising. In past years, I'd generally meet with my new advisees during weeks seven and eight to work on their four-year plans and other declaration materials. Since the schedule of courses was ready by then, the third years of those four-year plans were usually fairly concrete; we knew which courses were being offered and, generally, which would fit together in each semester.

This year, I'm meeting with most of my new advisees during week five. Why so early? Because I'll be at the ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education during week six, and I don't think I can successfully meet with all my advisees in week seven. Meeting in week five means that we can't look over the schedule of courses in putting together their four-year plans. Even if I was here during week six, we wouldn't be able to rely on the schedule of courses.

The great thing about combining the declaration of major with third-year planning is that when preregistration starts, my newly declared majors have done the hardest part of prereg. That is, they've already put together a plan for the coming fall. So a quick check-in is all that is required. Now, we'll need longer meetings as we try to see whether their planned courses will fit together (or are even offered in the semester they expected) and whether there are other courses they might consider. I worry that this changes is going to double my advising time for the new advisees.

When does the schedule come out? As far as I can tell, it's coming out at the end of week six. I'm pretty sure that it came out at the end of week six last year, too. That means last year, we had two weeks to meet with new advisees with the schedule in hand. This year, we have only one. That's not really enough. I hate having registration butt up against spring break. If something goes wrong, we usually end up having to wait until after spring break to resolve the issues. I'd much rather do things two weeks before spring break.

Oh well. Perhaps things will change next year. Or perhaps I'll be the one to change. I suppose I could cram all of my new-major advising appointments into that one week before spring break.

**_Postscript_**: Can you tell that I'm calmer than I used to be? Even my rants are relatively low key.

[1] This semester, we lost two days from those seven weeks: The College does not hold classes on MLK Day and we had a faculty retreat on the last Friday in January.

[2] I can't recall the last time we had a one-week spring break. But I know that it's a possibility.

[3] Since MAPs and 299s in the sciences most frequently involve students joining a faculty member's research project, we have students apply to the faculty before the faculty select students. After that, students apply to the College. Faculty also have to apply to the College for funding [4].

[4] That reminds me. I have a musing about this year's summer research application that I started more than a month ago. I think it's nearly complete. I'll try to post it soon.

[5] At 9am! Isn't that a fascinating time?
