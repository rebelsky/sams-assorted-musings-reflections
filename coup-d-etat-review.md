Last week, the boys [1] and I played a game of _Coup d'état_. 
I'd dug out a copy [2] a few months earlier after hearing one of them remark that they recalled it as one of Michelle's favorite games. 
I'm not sure that they recalled that at the time I put it out on the table, but _ce'st la vie_.

For those not familiar with the _Coup d'état_ [3], it's a four-player trick-taking card game that uses a 32-card French deck [4] with an extra card and the Ace-Ten ordering [5] from games like [_Belote_](https://www.pagat.com/jass/belote.html) [6].
The [version we play](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2174/coup-detat) was published by Parker Brothers in the mid-1960s.
I'm not sure if it existed before then; the rules claim it did, but I take such stories with a grain of salt.
It also seems odd to make a 33-card deck.
It also has a designer listed, G. W. "Jerry" D'Arcey, which suggests that it's not just a historical game.

In any case, _Coup d'état_ is played over four rounds, with each round consisting of six hands. 
Each hand has a different goal (or penalty). 
You might be asked to avoid taking queens, or the king of hearts, or spades, or the first and last hands. 
A designated "Director" generally chooses the goal of the current hand. 
The Director also receives the penalty payment from anyone who takes cards they shouldn't.
It's good to be the Director.

Each player gets to start one round as Director.
However, they don't necessarily remain Director.
That's where the variant of the French deck comes into play.
There's one additional card, the Coup card.
If you have the Coup card, you can choose to declare a coup.
When you declare a coup, you get to choose the hand (from those not yet played that round).
And the goals invert.
For example, instead of trying to avoid the queens, you try to take all the queens.
It's a bit like shooting the moon in _Hearts_.
If you succeed, you not only get to take over the Directorship, you also receive money from each of the other players.
If you fail, you pay a penalty to the bank, not the Director.
The Director gets all the money in the bank at the end of the round.

There's much to like about _Coup d'état_.
Choosing the best set of rules for the current hand, as Director or for a coup, can be a straightforward decision.
But there's often analysis involved: Which will likely garner you the most money? In the case of a coup, which of the remaining hands will succeed?
And there's also the question of whether or not to attempt the coup.
In our game, we had a few situations in which it was better to declare a coup, even though you knew you'd fail, than to skip the coup.

Playing _Coup d'état_ reminded me of how much I like playing card games. 
I may even like card games more than board games.
In general, card games have three key characteristics that I appreciate: Some strategy and planning that involves careful analysis, some randomness that may give less-skilled players a chance, and moderately simple rules.
Unfortunately, the strategy for most card games requires that you keep careful track of what's been played.
I'm not sure that I still have the brainpower for that.
Did I ever?

Speaking of brainpower, I found myself embarrassed by how many mistakes I made while playing. 
I've never been a great card player, but I was certainly much better.
I think.
Michelle might dispute that.
At times, I'm a bit too inclined to take risks, especially when playing _Canasta_. 
Nonetheless, I recall being better at deciding what cards to play when.
My primary care provider suggests that it's just that I was playing against my sons' younger and more capable brains.
But it's more than that.
I made some bad decisions.
Surprisingly bad.
Perhaps practice will help me rebuild my skills.
Or escaping from depression.
I don't know.

In any case, it's a game I recommend and that I hope to play again soon. [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2174/coup-detat) says that it's a thirty-minute game. However, with 24 hands of 32 cards each, along with some consideration of whether or not to attempt a coup, I'd peg it at closer to an hour or a bit more.

**_Postscript_**: I hope to convince Eldest to play _Claviash_ [7] or _Belote_ with me to help rebuild those brain cells.

[1] Men.

[2] Well, I'd purchased an extra copy.

[3] Presumably, everybody.

[4] Ace through seven in each of four suits. 

[5] Ten is the second-highest card, after Ace.

[6] _Belote_ is a variant of _Clobyosh_, which [I've written about previously](claviash-2020-04-30).

[7] My preferred spelling.
