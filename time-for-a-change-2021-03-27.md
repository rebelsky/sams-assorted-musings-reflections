"Hi, my name is Sam and I'm a workaholic."

"Hi Sam!"

"It's been almost *two hours* since I last did work that I didn't necessarily need to do." [2]

\[Murmurs of amazement from the crowd.\]

While there isn't a Workaholics Anonymous [3], I've spent the fall trying
to embrace some version of the Serenity Prayer, at least as it applies to
my workplace.

> G-d, grant me the *serenity* to accept the things I cannot change,
the *courage* to change the things I can, and the *wisdom* to know the
difference.

The problem is that my mother taught me that you never know what you can
change until you try.  At least that's the kind of life she seemed to live.

_That's not the right way to begin._

_Trying again._

A week or two ago, a friend posted a question on Facebook that went something like this: "When did you realize that your health was more important than your job?"  I responded something like "This past fall."  And it's true, I did try to prioritize my (mental) health this fall.  I even took the leap of starting regular therapy.  It may not have been obvious to others, but I stepped back in the fall.  I complained less.  I ignored concerns.  I tried to focus on positives.  

_That's not right, either._

---

_Once again._

One of the best things I've done during the pandemic is to start watching
[Danika and the Jeb](https://danikaandthejeb.com) on
[StageIt](https://www.stageit.com/danikaandthejeb).  I think I've
even [mused about them](obsessions-danika-and-the-jeb-daylist-2021-01-21) [4].
It's hard to pick a favorite Danika and the Jeb song.  However, as I was
sitting down to muse today, one of their song titles popped into my
head: "It's time for a change" [5].  Now, I don't think it's time for the
kind of change that's the subject of that song, a change in a relationship
between people.  But it is time for a different kind of a change, a change
in my relationships with work, with myself, and with life [5].

_Better, but still not right._

_Last try._

About two weeks ago, during my bi-weekly therapy session, I was discussing
the coming week with my therapist.  And I said something like "I've been
working close to capacity.  I have two huge tasks being added to that.
I feel completely overwhelmed."  He asked me some follow-up questions.
"Do these tasks have to be done?"  Yes.  "Can you pass them off to
someone else?"  No.  "Can you do them more efficiently?"  Not really.
I suppose I don't have to read over four-year plans for declaring students
and tell the students that the plans will not be possible, but then I
would not be meeting the (reasonable) standards I set for myself.

So we decided that I had two primary options.  I could accept that
my job naturally includes some points at which I will feel totally
overwhelmed.  I wouldn't be alone in that.  For example, there are
a few times a year that the farmers in Iowa feel totally overwhelmed
[7].  And if I wasn't willing to accept that my job (or at least
being Chair) includes times of being totally overwhelmed, I should
resign as Chair.

_Still not the best beginning, but the best I can do right now._

I thought about it.  In so many ways, I am more fortunate than
others.  It felt somehow wrong to step down as Chair, even though
chairing the department adds significant stress and work to my life,
far more than the 2/3 class per year I receive in credit for serving
as chair.  But saying "I've accepted the role of chair and I accept
that the workload from being chair is not in my control" felt good.

My body had a different opinion.

On Monday, when I lay down for bed at 10:30 or so after yet another 
difficult day [8], I felt strange.  My muscles ached, particularly my
biceps.  I associate those aches with colds.  It appears others don't.
I also felt nauseous.  I vomited [9].  I took acetaminophen [10].  I
vomited again.  My upper back started to ache.  I decided to do a Web 
search for the symptoms.

Damn.  Symptoms of a possible heart attack.  But it's strange.  

I called Michelle.  Well, I texted Michelle to make sure that she was
awake.  Then I called her.  She told me to wake up Eldest and have him
drive me to the hospital.

At Grinnell Regional Medical Center, they did the normal things you'd
expect.  They ran an EKG.  They gave me drugs [12].  They ran IVs.
The ER doctor told me that I seemed to be having a right-sided heart
attack and asked me whether I wanted to be air-flighted to Iowa City
or Des Moines [14].  I asked him to call Michelle and they settled on
Methodist Hospital in Des Moines.

They also asked me about pain levels.  I don't think I reported a pain
level over four, even when I came in.  It's not that I necessarily have
high pain tolerance; I've certainly felt worse than I felt.  But, in
my imagination, a heart attack should feel worse.  And it should be in
my chest.  "Arm ache plus nausea" is "I have a cold or flu".  Bleh.  I
guess that's one benefit of the pandemic; I was pretty damn sure I didn't
have a cold or the flu.

The coolest thing (other than getting to fly in a helicopter) was
that my in-flight nurses were Chad and Jeremy.  But they don't sing.
And I realized that I couldn't recall what songs Chad and Jeremy
did in any case [15].

At Methodist, they sent me to the Cardiac Cath lab.  They tell me that I
was out during the work, but I feel like I recall all of it.  In any
case, one of my coronary arteries was 95% occluded, so they put in a stent.
It seems that I have (had) thick blood, so they used a lot of heparin.
The other coronary arteries seem to be doing pretty well.

I came home from Methodist on Thursday.  I was hoping to come home on
Wednesday, since I seemed "well enough" by Wednesday morning.  But they
want you therefore at least 48 hours after surgery.

It seems like I'm doing pretty well.  Michelle says that I'm looking
better than I've looked in a while.  The output fraction from my
heart is in the normal range.  I feel okay, although a bit tired.

So now comes the hard part.  It's time for a change.  Well, it's
time for multiple changes.  I need to change my diet.  I need to
change my exercise habits.  I need to change my blood pressure.
And on that last note, I need to cut down on stress.  I need to cut
*way* down on stress.

But as I said at the beginning, I'm a workaholic.  For example,
even though I'm trying to cut down on stress, I did decide to run
through the list of students who indicated that they were declaring
a CS major to see if there were some who had not declared so that
we could nudge them.  And I did start to make the list of tasks I
have as Chair that someone else will probably need to take over
while I'm recovering.  It's beyond three pages.  I'm also making a mental
list of the other things that I can't pass on to other people, such
as discussing class observations with faculty or the five recommendation
letters that I'm supposed to write this weekend.

As I also said at the beginning, I'm my mother's son.  While there
are many things I can't change directly, there's a subset of those
things that I can change by raising related issues [16].  Will I
be able to stop pointing out things to improve?  I don't know.
Should I stop?  If they cause stress, I should.  Maybe I can find
a way to raise these issues without stressing about them.

What about the rest of spring?  I'm scheduled to teach two half-courses
in the spring, one new and one old.  I'm enthusiastic about both
topics.  Teaching brings me joy.  I *think* I can keep teaching
those courses a relatively low-stress activity.  Students won't
mind less work for me to grade, will they?  

I should be deciding soon; Grinnell's legendary two-week spring break
has morphed into a one-week (Thursday to Wednesday) "interim period"
Whether or not I teach spring two courses may depend most on when my
cardiac rehab gets scheduled.  It will also depend on how easy I find
it to put together a syllabus and schedule for each.

Department administrative business, on the other hand, generally
causes a lot of stress, probably more than it should.  Why?  Too
many years of things stacking up on each other, which makes it too
easy to see the negatives and too hard to see the positives.  The
sheer number of things [17] adds to the stress.  I definitely can't
lead the department for the rest of this academic year.  I'm debating 
whether or not I should even participate in department, division, or
faculty meetings [18].

I must say that my colleagues have been wonderful.  Some volunteered
to take over my grading.  Some volunteered to take on other
administrative responsibilities.  The Dean let me know that she
would find replacements for any of my tasks.  Our Consulting Associate
Dean [19] has taken on a huge amount.  My beyond-Grinnell colleagues
have offered to provide more human resources for the tasks I'm
working on.  A wide variety of folks have sent well wishes and
offered help.  Just so folks know, I appreciate the well wishes,
and the primary help I want right now is making sure that my family
feels supported.  (Nope, we don't need meals.)  I think the right
people are providing that help.

It's interesting how information about my heart attack has traveled.
For example, one friend heard about it from their high-school-aged
child, who said that it's a subject of gossip at the high-school.
It appears that students still remember Youngest and also know me
by first name.  But it's strange that high-school students know and
people who are much closer do not.  I apologize if I have not
contacted you directly to share the news.

Well, this has gone off the rails a bit, so let's wrap up with a
TL;DR.  I had a heart attack.  I got a stent.  The prognosis is
good.  I'm working on changing diet, increasing exercise, and cutting
stress from my life, which is mostly work-related stress.  At the
moment, I'm focusing on the near future.  I have incredibly awesome
friends and Grinnell colleagues and external colleagues and students
and alumni who are supporting me.  And I have an even more incredibly
awesome family.  I'm thankful, and I anticipate being okay.

**_Postscript_**: Somewhere, not so deep in the back of my mind, a little
voice is asking me whether I'm able to think and analyze and write as well
as normal.  I'm not sure.  I do recall that it took somewhere between six
months and a year to recover my mental capacity from one medical incident.

---

**_Postscript_**: RS, as I said at the beginning (or immediately after
this, if you look textually), I apologize.  You did teach me to write better
than this.  But I really wanted to get something out about the heart attack,
not least because some people now and some don't.  Consider the musing grist
for the mill for the lyric essay that may come in the future.  It could make
a good sequel to the last one.

---

[1] Sorry RS.  You taught me to do better than this.

[2] At the point I wrote that, it was true.  Although I'm supposed to
be taking a break from work, I'd done some work-related stuff on my
computer for more than an hour.  Read on in the musing to discover what.

[3] Or at least not a Workaholics Anonymous group that I belong to.

[4] I have a second musing to finish (or restart).

[5] Come to think of it, that's a strange ordering.

[6] I think at the time "Time for a Change" came out, they were "Danika
Holmes featuring Jeb Hart", but I'm comfortable calling that a "Danika
and the Jeb" song.

[7] Preferably, those are only the major planned times: planting and harvest.
Unfortunately, there are others.

[8] Difficult meeting in the a.m.  Difficult follow-up conversations.  Argument during ITS meeting. Dealt with annoying/dismissive letter from an administrator.  Spent a lot of time catching up on grading.  Discovered that grading software was broken at 10:00pm *after* I had sent out current grades to students.  There were other things, too, but I can't remember what they were.

[9] My nut allergy made me vomit enough as a child and young adult that I don't think much of it.

[10] I think that's "paracetamol" [11] for you Brits and perhaps others.

[11] Every time I see the word "paracetamol" I think of the Distraction's
"Paracetamol Paralysis", which is an amazing song.  It makes me sad that
it is likely that the only person who is reading this musing who knows the 
song is my longest friend.

[12] Not the fun kind.

[14] Given that there isn't an ambulance in Grinnell, it is *much* faster
to air flight someone.

[15] Ah: "A Summer Song" and "Yesterday's Gone".  Probably a few others.

[16] I'm being good, I'm not even coming up with examples.

[17] See the note above.  At present, the list includes four major
spring tasks, thirty-two or so smaller tasks, sixteen or so complex
department discussions to lead [20], eight summer tasks, eight major
fall tasks, and at least four other fall tasks.

[18] I find it amusing that some of the messages I've received from
colleagues say "We need you back to make your important comments
at division and faculty meetings."

[19] No, not CAD.

[20] I have fourteen listed, but some can/should split and I
like using powers of two.
