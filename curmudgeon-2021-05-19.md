As I mentioned [recently](eight-weeks-2021-05-17), I decided to attend
the Faculty Meeting on Tuesday, 18 May 2021.  I'm not sure whether or
not that was the right decision.  It's scary how much I fell
back into my old habits.  Some of them were good; while I can't greet
everyone, I do tend to try to reach out to some of the too-many folks
I know and say hi.  Some folks do the same to me.  And I do say the
occasional useful or positive thing.

But others are less good.  "Bad", one might even say, at least in some
cases.  What's bad?  First of all, there are the minor things.  I'm too
compelled to type comments, sensible and silly, in the chat.  

> What does 'Moved back' mean?

> And THANK YOU to Gina for running the Clickers when we're in person.

> Can we have a Qualtrics form to express our congratulations? [1]

> THANK YOU for everything Lesley!

> Can we get a summary of what the Trustees talked about at their
  meeting?  I know diversity and equity was a priority, as was the
  budget.  Were there other things?

Okay, those aren't so bad.  The first is a clarification.  The next
three are the traditional silly or semi-positive Sam.  The last is
a reasonable question.  At least I think it is.  Raynard used to
give us an overview of the meeting that was more detailed than the
outline-like summary we traditionally receive via email.  None of
these are so bad.  But none were necessary.  I need to learn
to stay silent.  In any case, I said that I was curmudgeonly.  So
let's move on to that. 

We'll start with the athletics schedule.  I support our varsity
athletes.  I think they know that.  And I appreciate that our PE
Faculty work hard to ensure that our athletes prioritize their
academics.  But I look at the athletics schedules and I worry.  One
team has all of the departure days and times listed as "TBD".  How
can we approve something we don't know about?  Another team has
three departures that wipe out all Friday afternoon classes on those
days.  Is that appropriate?  What are our general principles?  Is
there a late bus?  Even though I'm teaching a MWF afternoon course,
I decided to stay silent.  So I guess that's a positive change.
And someone else asked about the late bus.  But I thought about all
those issues, which means that I still have work to do.  I shouldn't
worry about such things.

When someone said something like "We've all made it through a
difficult year", I wanted to say "Not all of us."  But that seemed
rude.  And self-centered.  I looked for a friend who might sympathize
with the snark; although I had many friends there, I didn't think
anyone would take it the right way.  Does it sound better in a musing?
I'm not sure.  It's still rude, but it's also the way I reacted.
And I know others feel like I do, if not as severely.  It's been a
really difficult year and it builds on a difficult culture that harms
many of us.  As I said, I'm a curmudgeon.

There was a lot of great news at the meeting.  The President has
lifted the cap on tenure-line positions [3].  We're getting a 3%
raise.  As importantly, the staff are getting the same raise.  So
why did I want to make these remarks?? 

> Hmmm ... you've decided that we've all done a great job this year
and are giving everyone the same raise [4], why not make that the
regular policy?  Grinnell has excellent faculty and staff.  Why
have a policy that makes half the folks on campus feel bad because
they got less than the median?

> If it's that easy to lift the cap on the number of tenure-line
positions, why didn't it happen under President Kington? 

Somewhere during the meeting, we talked about the search for the
new Dean.  Perhaps it's that I'm burning out, but all I could think
was "I hope that we don't hire a new Dean that wants to put their
stamp on the institution."  Mike's "Opportunities for Research for
All" still has some fairly severe and inequitable lingering burdens
associated with it.  I'm not sure Anne had time to create an
initiative.  But each thing a Dean decides to do is another burden
on the faculty.  And that's a horrible way to feel. I want a new
Dean who is creative and enthusiastic; I just want there to be
appropriate levels of faculty support to undertake their creative
ideas.

Even when President Harris was talking about the need for more
sensible workloads among the folks on campus, all I could think was
"[Valued colleague] says we need to tackle it as a public health
issue, not an individual issue.  Are we thinking about things that
way?  Jen Jacobsen has been gone for more than a year.  Why don't
we have a new Wellness Director, which would help?  Why is the
Wellness Committee still on hiatus?"  At another point, when she
acknowledged how hard it is to cut back as a faculty member, I
wanted to write to a friend and say, 

> It was easy for me.  I had a heart attack.  That's made me
realize what's important and what's not.

See?  I'm a curmudgeon.  I'm a curmudgeon in so many different ways.

I'll admit that my curmudgeonliness seems to have changed.  There
were traditionally three primary motivating factors for my past
curmudgeonliness.  First of all, I care deeply about this institution,
and I worried that we were making decisions without considering
implications or while ignoring history or past practice.  Related
to that was trying to get folks to admit some of the mistakes we've
made.  Second, I've encountered so many changes to interpretations
that I now find myself insisting that we spell things out carefully
and correctly.  Third, I worried about the under-resourcing of the
CS department and its effects.  All affected my behavior.  But now
there's a fourth [6,7] factor [9] at play.

That under-resourcing, combined with careless or just plain bad
policies, helped bring me to the state at which I had a heart attack.
Those aren't the only things that contributed; my weight and lack
of exercise make a difference.  However, those are arguably also
consequences of having more work and more stress than was reasonable.
I'm not sure I've forgiven the institution [10].  How do I?  It
sounds like things may get better, but it's taken too damn long.
And what's that they say?  "Impact trumps intent".  I don't necessarily
agree [11], but it's hard not to feel that way.  Forgiveness is
hard.  Forgiveness is probably necessary.  Oh well, I guess that's
something to discuss with my therapist.

There were other curmudgeonly things, too.  I don't recall what all
of them were.  I'm not even sure I want or need to share the ones
I do remember.  So I'll leave it there and take it as a step forward
that I didn't feel compelled to make comments.  Perhaps I can stop
thinking about the negatives, the potential problems, the rest.

At least there are some positives.  When we heard about the new
faculty positions, I didn't ask "Where will you house them?"  Better
yet, I didn't even think it.  I've asked the question before,
multiple times.  In each case, an administrator said "Don't worry,
we have capacity." I'll assume that we do.  Isn't it sad that I
consider my failure to be curmudgeonly a positive?  Oh well.  I was
also positive in my interactions with others and my enthusiasm for
the promotion and tenure notifications and such.  Those are the
more important positives.

Despite the positives, I find myself asking whether or not I will
attend meetings again next year, when we're back in person.  I'm
not sure.  If I do, I'll hope that my hearing aids work appropriately.
And I'll try to stay silent.  My time of speaking out needs to be
done.  But if I don't speak, do I need to go?  It's nice to see
others; I'll go to the first faculty meeting of the year to see
people in person.  But the rest of the meetings?  We shall see.

**_Postscript_**: Here's another positive.  In general, writing
rants makes me upset [12].  This one felt much more neutral; I was
just reporting on what I felt.  I regret being curmudgeonly, but
writing about these issues doesn't make me any more upset about
them.  Progress!

---

[1] To the faculty who were promoted and/or tenured [2].

[2] Yes, we had at least one who was tenured without being promoted.

[3] Yay!  Thank you, Anne!  And thank you, Elaine and Vida and others,
for your hard work helping President Harris understand the issues at
play.  And thank you BoT for agreeing!

[4] Not quite, but close.

[5] I'm not sure that there's an acceptable answer to that question.
There is an obvious one.

[6] Or perhaps a zeroth, if you count like a computer scientist.

[7] Not Forth.  That's a programming language.  [8]

[8] Or perhaps an adverb, as in "Go forth, Grinnellian!"

[9] Are they multiplicative?  I'm not sure.

[10] For that matter, I'm not sure I've forgiven myself.

[11] Musing forthcoming.

[12] Okay, more upset.
