This past week, I attended the 2022 ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium
in Computer Science Education.  Or is that redundant?  After all,
SIGCSE stands for "Special Interest Group in Computer Science
Education" [1].  Anyway, the SIGCSE TS is a large, annual conference
on CS education, traditionally one of the best venues for hearing
and presenting research in CS ed.  Two years ago, I was at a hotel
in Portland [3], waiting to attend the first day of the 2020 Technical 
Symposium when the Governor shut down the state [4].  The 2021 TS
was online.  But the 2022 TS was back in person.  Well, it was hybrid,
but you could be there in person.

Wow.  That was too much intro.  It's probably a bad sign.  But I want
to get things down before I forget, so I'll be editing less than normal [5].
As the tags suggest, this musing will be disjoint.

In short: I got to attend a conference.  I got to attend a conference
_in person_.  It was freakin' awesome.  There was so much I appreciated
about the conference.  It was wonderful to see old friends and to
make a few new ones; SIGCSE is my professional community and there
are many people I know and care about who attend.  (It's also nice
to know that many of them care about me, too.)

The program was also wonderful.  A few years ago, I was feeling a
bit burned out on the SIGCSE TS.  But I found myself once again
excited to attend sessions and to learn new things.  It helped that
the keynotes were spectacular.  On the first day, we had [Dr. Barbara
Liskov](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/barbara-liskov), who
invented many key aspects of modern programming languages.  Liskov
spoke about the role of history.  I was sad that she was a remote
speaker, but it was also great to see her speak from her kitchen.
On the second day, we had [Dr. Barbara
Ericson](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/barbara-ericson), who has
made a huge difference in K-12 CS education and in diversifying the
field.  Just listening to her made me want to start new projects.
And on day three, we had [Dr. Shaundra B.
Daily](https://www.shanibphd.com), who helped us think about
other issues of diversity and inclusion in computing.

I managed to make it to a variety of sessions on ways we help CS
majors develop a sense of responsible computing and how we assess
whether they have developed that sense.  The sessions included a
pre-conference meeting, a birds-of-a-feather conversation, and a
panel on responsible computing and computing for social good in CS2
(aka "Data Structures and Algorithms") [6].  I learned a lot from
multiple conversations with [Kathi Fisler](https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/)
of Brown [7].  I particularly appreciated Kathi's comment that "We
need to have majors who do a risks analysis as naturally as they
do a runtime analysis" [8].  I also made it to a pre-conference
session on accessibility where I got to chat with the legendary
[Amy Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/).

At the post-conference dinner, someone asked me what the best part
of the conference was and what the worst part was.  Seeing people
was definitely the best part.  The keynotes were a close second.
Having lots of people applaud my question at the third keynote
was also nice [9].  I struggled more to think of things I didn't
like.  I eventually came up with two. There was a lot of sound bleed
between rooms, which I struggle with because of my hearing issues.
Because some talks were hybrid, slides were smaller than normal
(the screen also showed camera feeds), which made them hard to read.
But those were comparatively minor.  And the sound bleed is inevitable
at most conference venues.

What else?  There was so much, it's hard to remember it all.  Here
are the notes I put together for my departmental colleagues.  Some
are directly about the program.  Others are more indirectly about
the program.

* As I've said before, I think we need to revise our goals for our
graduates.  That was re-emphasized at the conference when we were
asked to look at our program goals and how they addressed ethics
and responsible computing.  Our current statement does not include
such goals (except for nonmajors) and should.

* Kathi Fisler has some nice stuff about incorporating social
responsibility in CS2.  The material is available at
<https://responsibleproblemsolving.github.io>.  The Social Threat
Modeling section there has an instrument that some of us would find
useful.  

* The CS2022 [10] draft material is at <https://csed.acm.org>.  It
seems like things are in rapid transition.  In the big discussion,
there was a lot of push for a smaller core.  And it sounds like the
leaders agreed.

* As I mentioned, I was happy to see "desirable professional
dispositions" in the new CS2022 material.  And I was happier to hear
someone as data oriented as a Google data engineer (the one in
charge of the Software Design Knowledge Unit) suggest that there
are important things we want our students to achieve that we
nonetheless should not asses [12].

* Beyond social responsibility across the curriculum (and how we
assess it), I was most inspired to think about the role of Parsons
Problems (Barbara Erickson's keynote inspired that) and about more
ways to do interactive stuff online.  (Barb's talk also encouraged
me to look at [Runestone](https://runestone.academy) for that.)

* Barbara Liskov's talk inspired me to think more about the role
of history in the CS curriculum.

* I talked to the GitHub folks about how we can achieve "pseudonymous"
use of GitHub [14].

* I had a nice talk with the folks from [Ed](https://edstem.org)
(yet another discussion forum, this one with integrated code
evaluation and some nice templating).  David Malan also recommended
it in a "technology we can't live without" talk.  I plan to look
at it more.

* I attended a session about the [Google Tech Writing
courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing).  They have a
forthcoming course on writing for accessibility which seems
interesting.  I also liked that they reinforce "think about your
audience".  I'll be looking forward to ways to use those materials.

Amazingly, that only scratches the surface.  I talked to colleagues
at other institutions about a possible joint research project.  I
found myself inspired to move forward on some others.  I reflected
on how I can contribute to CS2022 (and was asked whether I would
contribute).  I thought a lot about how to teach better.  I also
built a large list of things to read, do, reflect on, and more.

Still, the best part was being able to be in person with this
amazing community.

I am so very thankful to the Symposium co-chairs, Maureen Doyle and
Larry Merkle, to the Program co-chairs, Brian Dorn, Judithe Sheard,
and Leen-Kiat Soh, and to the hybrid chair, Kristin Stephens-Martinez,
and to everyone else involved in putting on such a wonderful conference
in such complicated times.

I'm also thankful to the sponsors, who help keep the conference
affordable and who provide technologies and texts [15] that we rely
on.  (I also like the swag that I get to share with my students,
assistants, and family.)

I look forward to SIGCSE TS 2023 in Toronto and SIGCSE TS 2024 back
in Portland!

**_Postscript_**: I'm sure that Kristin Stephens-Martinez and Mark
Guzdial, among others, will have much better summaries of the conference
in their 'blogs or other reporting.

**_Postscript_**: I also appreciate that the TS was in Providence, RI,
which meant that I got to see Eldest Son and one of my best friends
from college.

[1] And for those who are confused by the latecomer with the same initials,
ACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery [2].

[2] The ACM permits humans, too.

[3] Oregon.

[4] I had also hoped to catch a 'Blazers game, since the arena was only
two blocks from the hotel.  That was a fail, too.  If I recall correctly,
the 'Blazers were one of the first teams to have a player infected.

[5] Yes, I realize that's hard to envision.

[6] Grinnell's version of CS2 was once CSC-152 and is now CSC-207.  Like
many institutions, we've added a CS1.5 (CSC-161).

[7] Among other things, Kathi is a driving force in the [Bootstrap
project](https://bootstrapworld.org), which is doing amazing things at
getting computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum.

[8] Paraphrased.

[9] I asked one of my common questions.

> Most companies, even companies that claim to be committed to
equity, expect to see students who spend significant time on computing
outside their normal class work.  But I have students who need to
work twenty or more hours per week and don't have time for
extracurricular computing projects.  How do we get these companies
to understand that their criteria promote inequity?

The question was particularly relevant because Dr. Daily noted that
one of her graduate professors told her that she should not have any
interests outside of engineering.

[10] CS2022 is the once-a-decade effort to put together curricular
recommendations for computer science programs.  It is sponsored by
the ACM, the IEEE, and AAAI.  I'll let you guess what the acronyms
mean.  Grinnell was one of only a few exemplars listed in [the
2013 version](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf) [11].

[11] Gathering and writing information on our program and getting
it into a usable form (as well as designing that usable form) took
a significant amount of Henry Walker's and my time one summer, and
also involved a lot of contributions by our department colleagues.

[12] Long-time readers know that I worry that assessment steers us
to easily measurable outcomes, rather than more important outcomes
that are difficult or expensive to measure.

[14] ITS has said that we can only use GitHub in our classes if we
provide students with accounts that obscure their identity.  The
problems are (a) faculty can't create GitHub accounts for students
and (b) the GitHub terms of service indicate that one should not
create multiple accounts for themselves.  Fortunately, Grinnell's
FERPA officer helped me work out an intermediate solution.

[15] It was nice to see the new CLRS.  But it was sad to see that Tom
and company have not renamed The Master Theorem.
