The Cut/Close/Balance process for Spring 2022 just finished.  From
what I can tell, it was messier than normal.  More introductory courses
over-enrolled.  More courses overall over-enrolled.  The mix of
over-enrolled courses changed a bit.

From my quick overview, most of my advisees did okay.  Many lost one
course but had a backup.  Unfortunately, a lot of the lost courses
were what we might call "breadth" courses: Introduction to American
Studies, Introduction to the Studio, Introduction to Gender, Women's,
and Sexuality Studies.

I assume I'm not the only advisor with students in this situation.
And I expect that some parents are also thinking about what their
children might take.  So I thought I'd put together a short list
of open courses that students might find of interest.  They aren't
in a particular order; mostly they are ones that came to mind or
that I found in looking.  Those of you looking for my broader
comments about the CCB will have to wait for a future musing.

On to the open courses students might consider.

First up is CSC-105, _The Digital Age_.  As I say regularly, computers
are changing the world, for both good and bad.  I'd say that all liberal
arts students have some obligation to learn something about computing.
CSC-105 is the department's broader intro to computing and issues
related to computing.  It also includes a bit of Python, a useful
programming language that we don't otherwise cover in the Grinnell CS
curriculum.  Plus, it's taught by the amazing Liz R [1].  Folks should
consider it!

There are twenty-plus slots available in ECN-111, _Introduction to
Economics_.  For better or worse, economic principles seem to govern
what happens in the US and across the world.  It's probably a good
idea to learn more about them.

Every liberal education should include some study of the creative
arts.  While Introduction to the Studio and Drawing are both closed,
there are certainly other ways to explore and understand the arts.
Students can take ARH-103, _Introduction to Art History_.  Since
the class is balanced, they'll need a note from the professor, but
I expect that won't be a problem.  There's also a special topic on
the _Art of India_.   There are many benefits to knowing about art;
I know I can get joy in every city I visit by visiting museums [2].

Of course, other arts are available.  Slots are available in THD-111,
_Intro to Performance Studies_, and THD-202, _Theatre History II_,
if you want to reflect on the theory and practice of performance.
Slots are also available in THD-117, _Introduction to Acting_, if
you'd like to develop those artistic skills [3].  There's also a
one-credit special topic entitled "Tap is Music".  What's the
description?

> Hoofing and tap dancing continue to live at a nexus, however
marginalized, of American culture and consciousness. We - as
musicians, dancers, actors, performers, thinkers, artists, humans,
and as institutions - have much to learn from tap dancing. When a
discipline is divided a wholeness is lost: tap reunites what was
once one. This course explores facets of tap dance fundamentals,
musical collaboration, and cultural contexts and awareness, through
rehearsal, reflection, experimentation, and performance. Dates:
January 25-27 and April 26 to May 5. Short course deadlines apply.
Prerequisite: None.

Tap transitions us to music.  There are a few slots available in
MUS-112, _Music Theory_.  There are a few more slots available in
MUS-116, _Music, Culture, Context_.  As someone who does not know
nearly enough about music, I'll say I'm always amazed at the depth
with which my offspring discuss music and that I expect that courses
like this help build that depth.  And, in case you didn't realize
it, some 200-level music courses don't have prerequisites.  For
example, you could take MUS-201-01, _Music, Gender, and Sexuality_
or MUS-201, _Opera: Death, Drama, Desire_ [4], or MUS-202-01, _Sonic
Activism_.  Gender, Sex, Desire, Activism.  These are things
Grinnellians love.  Or love to talk about.  The courses seem to
be great opportunities.  It looks like _Sonic Activism_ also includes
a performance component.

Every description of modern liberal education of which I am aware
includes "understand the other" as a key goal or component.  While
there are many ways to understand others, religion plays such a
role in many people's lives that developing some knowledge of
religion and religious beliefs can provide insight.  REL-103,
_Studying Religion: Middle East_, REL-104, _Studying Religion:
India_, and REL-105, _Studying Religion: East Asia_ all have room.
For those with second-year (or above) standing, REL-214, _Christian
Scriptures_, REL-240, _Religion is Everywhere_, and REL/HIS-268,
_Islam and Gender_ are all valuable opportunities.  There are also
three special topics courses open to those with second-year standing
or another religious studies course: REL-295-01, _Gender Relations
in South Asia_, REL-295-02, _Pilgrimage/Voyage/Journey_, and
REL-295-03, _Reckoning with the Holocaust_.  I suppose HIS-100,
_The Prophet Muhammad_, might also provide a related insight into
an important culture (or, more accurately, important cultures).

Language can be another way to understand the other.  This spring
is the first term in recent memory in which slots remain open in
LIN-114, _Introduction to General Linguistics_.  Since third-years
and seniors cannot pre-register for LIN-114, I assume this course
will fill quickly.

Given the horror of modern American politics [6] and the historical
popularity of Political Science at Grinnell, I'm surprised to see
that there are still slots available in POL-101, _Introduction to
Political Science_.  I'd hope everyone would want to take that.

Speaking of science, some might want to explore the physical,
natural, or mathematical sciences.  While Biology, Chemistry,
Computer Science, Mathematics, Psychology, and Statistics are all
full, room remains in PHY-131, _General Physics I_.  As I said,
it's a weird year.  The spring section of PHY-131 is taught in
workshop style; rather than separating lecture and lab, workshop-style
physics focuses on active learning methodologies that incorporate
lab-like activities throughout the course.

Careful study of language and literature not only provides insight
into other cultures but also helps you develop your skills.  About
fifteen slots are available in ENG-120, _Literary Analysis_.  I'm
pretty sure that ENG-120 is one of those multi-topic courses.  Let's
see ... ENG-120-01 and ENG-120-02 are _Globalization and Modernity
in Anglophone World Literature_; ENG-120-04 appears to focus on E.
Bronte's _Wuthering Heights_ and Shakespeare's _Twelfth Night_.
You can read their descriptions in [the schedule of
courses](https://webadv-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/WAPROD/WAPROD?type=P&pid=ST-X3WSEI).
Since ENG-120 is balanced, instructor permission is required to add
it.

You can't start a new language in the spring. At least I don't
see first-semester introductory language courses on the schedule;
I'll admit that I didn't look that hard.  But if you know a language
and didn't continue it in the fall, you might continue it in the
spring.  Most languages have a few slots available.

There are a few more courses that have a few spaces.  But the courses
above should help most students broaden their education.  Consider
taking one or more of these great courses.  Review [the schedule

more details.

And don't forget to consult with your advisor!

[1] No relation.  The R's also have different subsequent letters.

[2] I realize that this sentence doesn't quite fit.  I'm too lazy
to figure out a better location.

[3] Hmmm.  I seem to have switched from third person to second.  Oh well.

[4] Since JWB has used up her D's in the course title, you can be sure
you'll do well [5].

[5] That was one of my traditional mediocre jokes.

[6] Is "horror" too light a word?
