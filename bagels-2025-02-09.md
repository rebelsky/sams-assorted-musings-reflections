I've been making bagels for a long time. I can't remember when I started. Did I make them in high school? In college? Or did I start after Michelle and I got married. Michelle would know. I'm not sure anyone else would. Strike that; I seem to recall that my Resident Assistants from college, who read my musings, commented on me making bagels. And perhaps Adena knows [1]. Maybe other college friends.

For awhile, bagels were a key part of the Rebelsky Ground Hog's Day Celebrations. So were my dad's baked eggs, but those are a topic for another musing. Making bagels for a brunch means getting up early for the rising and the boiling and the baking. At times, I felt like the Dunkin' Donuts guy "Time to make the -donuts- bagels."

At some point, offspring activities made it difficult to hold our annual Ground Hog's Day Celebration; for some reason, swim meets kept popping up on that weekend. Now they're done. Maybe I'll restart the celebration next year. Can I do one myself? That's a separate musing. 

In the mid twenty-teens, middle son decided that we should make bagels at Thanksgiving. Why Thanksgiving? I've never completely understood why, other than that it gave him an excuse to invite friends over early in the morning. And so we've made bagels for Thanksgiving ever since. I've always made the recipe from _Love & Knishes_ [2].

> * 8 cups flour
> * 1 tablespoon salt
> * 1 tablespoon sugar
> * 2 cakes fresh yeast (I can't find this anymore, so I always look up the alternatives)
> * 2 cups lukewarm potato water (water in which peeled potatoes have been cooked)
> * 1/4 cup salad oil
> * 4 eggs, slightly beaten
> * 2 tablespoons sugar
> * 2 quarts boiling water
> * poppy seed or sesame seed (optional)

> Sift together dry ingredients into a large mixing boxl. Soften yeast in one third of the potato water. Add to the flour. Add oil to the remaining potato water and stir into the flour mixture. Add eggs and stir briskly to form a ball of dough.

> Knead on a lightly floured board for ten minutes. This must be a firm dough; add more flour if necessary. Return to the bowl, smooth side up. Cover with a tea towel and let rise at room temperature until the dough rises to the top of the bowl. Knead again on a lightly floured board until smooth and elastic (as for rolls). Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between the palms to form ropes about 6 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Pinch the ends together firmly to make a doughnut shape.

> Add sugar to boiling water. Drop bagels into the water one at a time. As they come to the surface, turn them over. Boil 1 minute longer on the second side. Please on a greased cooky sheet and bake at 450 degrees until the crust is golden brown and crisp (10 to 15 minutes). Bagels may be sprinkled with poppy seed or sesame seed before baking, if desired. Makes about 30.

We like to share (probably my inclination, but definitely one that middle son expanded), so the number of bagels we made grew. And grew. I believe one year, we made a gross. Perhaps even a baker's gross [3]. I recall using something like twenty-five pounds of flour. But our lives got busy. Busier. And the kids were only home for Thanksgiving. So we cut back. This past year, we only made enough for ourselves [4].

I also got older. So I left much of the work to Middle. He loves to bake. I think he bakes something every week [5]. And, well, the recipe morphed. At some point, he started adding baking soda to the boiling water. Why? "It's basic dad; it makes a better crust" [6].

Or perhaps just been completely replaced. I asked him about his recipe, and here's what he sent me.

> The night before ... Make the Mix

> * Probably about 2 cups of water
> * Enough flour to make a thick paste
> * Healthy tablespoon of gluten
> * Together with a dash of sugar and yeast
> * Let sit overnight

> In the morning

> Knead as much flour into the dough as you can. Let proof until doubled.  Punch down, divide into equal sized balls.  Shape bagels (these days I punch a hole in the ball and spin until a nice shape).  In a pan, add some molasses and baking soda to boiling water, then boil the bagels for 1-2 minutes on each side.  After that, pat the bagels dry and bake at 350 until done.

I now know what it's like to get a recipe from a Jewish Grandmother. How many bagels does this make? How much flour do I end up using? What's a "dash" of yeast? How does that scale?

Also: What happened to making ropes? Where are the eggs? The oil? _Where is the potato water!?_ It's bad enough that I had to give up on the yeast cakes, which were so much fun to work with. But no potato water? Blasphemy!

Nonetheless, I must admit that his bagels were yummy. Really yummy. Eldest called these bagels, along with lox, cream cheese, tomatoes, red onions, and such, "Happiness sandwiches". I know what he means.

This weekend, I decided I'd try to make some myself. We're headed to a Super Bowl party, and I wanted to bring something. Why bagels? Ask my muse. She [7] inspires me to do more than muse. I wanted to make enough to share. So I asked. "How much water would you use for ten pounds of flour?" Of course, he had no idea. However, we were able to approximate by referring to [a recipe from King Arthur flour](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/martins-bagels-recipe) by Martin Philip. It bears some similarities to my son's, but also has some key differences, such as how long you rest the mix ("poolish", in Philip's terms),how the dough should feel ("cohesive, shaggy, tacky mess; resist the urge to add more flour" vs Middle's "add as much flour as possible"), and the temperature (475 vs Middle's 350).

I was still going to use potato water. Feed the yeast appropriately! Unfortunately, we didn't have any potatoes in the house. And, at the time when I was making the mix, I wasn't really in the mood to go out shopping. So, no potato water. I found some potato starch; hopefully, it achieves the same goals.

Middle and I decided that two quarts of water would be appropriate for ten pounds of flour. We under-estimated. I added an extra cup in the morning and ended up using about nine pounds. I think two and a half would have been nearly perfect. Or maybe a little too much. I'll figure that out next time.

Of course, as we were chatting, Middle also decided to update his instructions. Let's see. What did he say?

> Lately Iâ€™ve been pouring the baking soda into a dry pan, cooking off the water in it (sodium bicarbonate breaks down into sodium carbonate and water at boiling water temps, so you get a stronger base out).

You gotta love chemists! 

He also suggested that I proof the yeast before making the mix. Sugar, slightly warm water, yeast, fuzzy bubbles. QED!

I must admit that poking holes in balls of risen dough is more fun than making ropes. Making ropes was fun. Pinching them together was a joyful challenge. But the feeling of risen dough? Awesome.

At about the point that I was toasting the baking soda, I realized that I'd never added any salt. There wasn't any salt in his recipe? Salt is yummy. But it's also bad for me. So perhaps it's absence is for the best. The taste will be the test.

I've learned that it's good to keep records. Here's my final ingredient list (approximate).

> * 9 cups of water.
> * 2 Tbs of yeast.
> * 2 Tbs of sugar.
> * 1/2 cup of potato starch.
> * 1/4 cup of gluten.
> * 9 pounds of flour.
> * 5 Tbs baking soda. (Start with 2 Tbs; add another tablespoon each time you add more water to the pan.)
> * 5 Tbs blackstrap molasses. (Start with 2 Tbs; add another tablespoon each time you add more water to the pan.)

Each ball of dough was about 112 grams. I ended up with 48 bagels, plus one small bit of dough left over.

**_Postscript_**: If I want to make another gross, I suppose I'll need about thirty pounds of flour. And help. And much more time.

[1] Yup. She says I made bagels in college and taught her how, too.

[2] Apparently, the book was published as _Love and Kishkes_ in the UK. Or maybe down under.

[3] Does such a thing exist?

[4] I suppose there are also other reasons for that. I'm amazed that we were able to make anything.

[5] Take note ladies, he's a catch!

[6] A baker and a chemist! Such a catch! Handsome, too.

[7] I realize that I previously referred to my muse as "they". Today, they identify as female. Gender is malleable [8].

[8] Do you pronound that as "mail-uh-bull" or "mail-y-uh-bull"?
