As I've noted in [my prior musing](crashplan-softlinks-2023-05-09) and [the one before that](crashplan-dotfiles-2023-05-08), ITS at Grinnell has installed CrashPlan on College-owned faculty and staff laptops.  CrashPlan is cloud-based backup software that also permits local backups.

I was a bit excited when I first learned about CrashPlan.  While I regularly make backups using Time Machine [1], it never hurts to have another backup system.  For example, restoring from Time Machine isn't always as straightforward as I'd like.

[1] More precisely, my Mac makes the backups when I plug in my external drives.
