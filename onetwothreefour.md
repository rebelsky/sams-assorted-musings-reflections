Paul McCartney sang, "_One two three four!_" and then moved on to, "_She was just seventeen, and you know what I mean._"

Dee Dee Ramone sang, "_Onetwothreefour!_"  Joey followed up with "_Well the kids are all hopped up and ready to go._"  I suppose Dee Dee started lots of songs with "_Onetwothreefour!_"  I wouldn't call it a trademark, but it's definitely a theme.

Jonathan Richman went a little further.  He sang, "_One two three four five six!_" and "_Roadrunner, Roadrunner_".  Then he sang about Stop&Shop and Route 128.

Those are the first few songs that come to mind when I hear "one two three four".  I suppose I also hear the number _five_, too.

I sang the first two songs to Eldest when he was little.  No, he didn't end up as a punk rocker, even though I sang, "_Eldest is a punk rocker_".  The third song lives in my head.  You'd think I'd remember more one-two-three-four songs.  Many songs have a count up, or a count in, as I believe it's officially called.  

Let's see what else the Interweb comes up with.

How could I have forgotten "Wooly Bully"?  Sam (not me) sang "_Uno dos one two tres quatro!_"  My friend Que reminded me of this one, too.

The Beatles' "Taxman" begins "_One two three four one two_", but it's not as obvious as in "I Saw Her Standing There."  You can easily miss it.

The Temptations' "Ball of Confusion" begins "_One two one two three four_".  Again, it's a bit more subtle than in many other songs.  But, wow, "Ball of Confusion" is such a fantastic song.  The rest are, too.

John starts "Give Peace a Chance" with "_One two one two three four_".

The Rascals start "Good Lovin'" with "_One two three_" but no four.  In stereo, the voices bounce around.

[Songfacts](https://www.songfacts.com/category/songs-that-start-with-a-count-in), which I've been using to find some of these songs, tells me that the Clash's "White Man in Hammersmith Palais" starts with a count in.  I can't hear it in [the official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96UtZPLiT90).  Nonetheless, I think there's a count in.  It sounds like it's Topper Headon.  As with "Taxman" and "Ball of Confusion", it seems less central than in "Sheena", "Roadrunner", or "Wooly Bully".  The count-in in "Clampdown" is somewhere in between.

There's another list on [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/WillMak5389/rhythm_counts_in_songs__counting_off_/).  I'm intrigued to see that they list different James Brown and ELO songs.  Probably different songs by other artists.  I'm too lazy to investigate them in depth.  I tend to stick to the ones I know.

I suppose it's worth giving ChatGPT a chance, too.

> **List songs that begin "one two three four"**

> Certainly! Here are a few songs that begin with the lyrics "one two three four":

> 1. "Blitzkrieg Bop" by Ramones
> 2. "I Wanna Be Sedated" by Ramones
> 3. "Rock and Roll All Nite" by Kiss
> 4. "Jailhouse Rock" by Elvis Presley
> 5. "You Really Got Me" by The Kinks
> 6. "Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry
> 7. "Jumpin' Jack Flash" by The Rolling Stones
> 8. "My Generation" by The Who
> 9. "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & His Comets
> 10. "I Saw Her Standing There" by The Beatles

> These are just a few examples, and there may be other songs that begin with those lyrics as well.

Let's check those answers.

1. "Blitzkrieg Bop" by Ramones [1].  Almost certainly.  It's a Ramones song.  But let's make sure.  **Yup**.  There's Dee Dee again.
2. "I Wanna Be Sedated" by Ramones.  **Nope**, even though it's the Ramones.  It starts with "_Twenty twenty twenty four_", which is not "_One two three four_".  I suppose I can see how ChatGPT got confused.  Four numbers, ending in four.  On another note, I also sang this to Eldest.  Yeah, I was a weird dad.  I still am.
3. "Rock and Roll All Nite" by Kiss.  **Nope**.  Michelle snapped along to this, though.
4. "Jailhouse Rock" by Elvis Presley.  **Nope**.  Another great song, though.
5. "You Really Got Me" by The Kinks.  **Nope**.  I didn't recall it starting with anything other than the riff.
6. "Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry.  **Nope**.  Maybe ChatGPT is looking for riffs, not count-ins.
7. "Jumpin' Jack Flash" by The Rolling Stones.  **Maybe**.  There's a quick "_One two_" at the beginning.  At least I think it's a "_One two_".  Also a recognizable riff.
8. "My Generation" by The Who.  **Nope**.  Maybe ChatGPT heard it as "_People try to teach us to c-count_".
9. "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & His Comets.  **Maybe**.  It starts "_One two three o'clock four o'clock rock_".  Not quite what I was looking for, but close enough for folk, as they say.
10. "I Saw Her Standing There" by The Beatles.  **Yup**.  I had the one already.

3/10.  4/10 if we're feeling generous.  Not so good, ChatGPT!  Should I ask for more?

Oh.  I guess I asked the wrong question.  Or ChatGPT misinterpreted. These aren't "more songs", they are more details.  

I think I'll stop now.

In case you were wondering: My muse indicated that musing 1234 had to be about count-ins.  She's had worse ideas.

_**Postscript**_: Will I be able to avoid using and making fun of ChatGPT in my upcoming musings?  Let's hope it's only an occasional detour.  Only my muses know for sure.

[1] I always think of them as _The_ Ramones.  But I see that they regularly use "Ramones".

[2] I appear to have "Summer Lovin'" on my mind.
