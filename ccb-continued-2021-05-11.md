In yesterday's musing, I reflected on [the broad changes wrought by the
Fall 2021 Cut, Close, and Balance period](post-prereg-2021F).  I ended
the musing by noting that I had to check on my advisees, including the
two who had already written to me.

In addition to the five students graduating this term, who should
not need courses, I have twenty-four returning advisees.  I'm not
completely sure of their distribution because of the effects of
leaves, but I think I have ten in the class of 2022, five in the
class of 2023, and nine in the class of 2024 [1].  One in the class
of 2022 is taking a semester off to pursue an internship.  Of the
nine Tutorial students, four were cut from a course.  Of the five
in the class of 2023, four were cut from a course.  Of the nine
registering the class of 2022, only two were cut from a course.
Ten out of twenty-three were cut; about 45%.  I wonder if that's
normal.  

I also wonder if it's normal that those in the class of 2023 suffer
the brunt of cuts.  Two of the four were CS majors hoping to take
two CS courses in the Fall who were cut to one course.  Handling
over-enrollments in CSC-324 and CSC-341 was a bear.  And we did
prioritize seniors over third-years [2].  The other two were cut
from severely over-enrolled courses: Intro Studio and History of
Education.  Oh, that's right, one was cut from two courses, CS
and Peace and Conflict Studies.  It's awful to be cut from two
courses [3].

What else were my advisees cut from?  Two were cut from Peace and
Conflict Studies, a rising second-year student and a rising third-year.
I wonder who gets prioritized for that course.  Or maybe it's random.

Cuts are painful.  But are they more painful than being prevented
from registering for a course in the first place?  I'm not sure.
As I've said before, I think our registration system is complicated,
but I haven't heard suggestions of a better one.  However, I do
wonder whether we could be more of a data-driven institution, as
President Kington suggested when he started.  For example, if we
required students to fill out four-year plans in Self Service,
rather than on paper, we could learn more about predicted demand.
Student choices change [4], but having a general sense of what they
plan might help.

[1] Tutorials normally have twelve students.  This year, Tutorial numbers
were often down.  Two of my Tutorial students decided to take a gap year
and one decided to transfer.

[2] Should "third-years" be hyphenated?  Grammarly says so, but I don't
know a good rule for it.  "Third-year students" should be, but that's not
at issue here.

[4] Unsurprisingly.
