This year, we've seen a significant uptick in the number of students
planning to take introductory-level CS courses over the summer and
requesting transfer credit so that they can more quickly progress
through the CS major.  The most common requests right now seem to
be for courses held at the University of California, Berkeley [1].
In particular, Berkeley has a discrete mathematics course [3] that
is fairly similar to Grinnell's MAT/CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_,
as well as a data structures and algorithms course [4] that is
fairly similar to Grinnell's CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Design, Data
Structures, and Algorithms_.  That shouldn't be surprising.  At
least in the big picture, our discrete and data structures courses
are fairly standard [5].

Berkeley also has an SiCP [6,7] course that we have counted as an
equivalent to CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_.  I don't think
anyone has asked to take that this year.

I have mixed feelings about students taking introductory courses
at other
International Students

https://summer.berkeley.edu/international/registration-fees

$570 per unit + $450 registration + $400 international student fee + $63 document management fee.

Domestic students

https://summer.berkeley.edu/application/fees

$570 per unit + $450 registration + $63 document management fee

I had assumed they were online courses.  But they're not.  They're in-person.
That ups the cost significantly.  Or maybe they're not.  61BL permits fully
remote.

[1] Aka "Berkeley" aka "Cal" [2].

[2] There are also the names that Stanford students are known to use to
refer to UCB.  I will not list them here.

[3] Math 55

[4] CS 61B, _Data Structures_

[5] Our discrete is atypical in that it tries to combine the
mathematical with the computational; students write proofs and
programs.  Our data structures is atypical primarily in that we do
not expect that students know the programming language we use in
the course (Java) in advance of the course and that we also cover
some OOP issues, including polymorphism (both subtype and parametric),
inheritance, and encapsulation.  When I teach it, we also make sure
to cover anonymous inner classes and lambdas.

[6] Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.  Named after
[the textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
by Abelson and Sussman and Sussman.  SiCP was once the primary introductory
course at MIT, but is no longer.  Berkeley still offers it.

[7] COMPSCI 61A, _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.
