A few days ago, a friend responded to [my musing about a day's work](overcommitment-2025-03-06) with a note that they fondly remember their father grading homwork with the family while they watched TV. I have similar fond memories. Particularly these past two years, Michelle and I spent a lot of time together in the front room, watching TV. Or at least she watched TV; I sat on my computer and graded and prepped and answered email and half-watched TV. She wasn't thrilled that I would occasionally stop and ask her what had just happened. Or, worse yet, I'd ask what had happened fifteen minutes earlier that led up to the current situation. 

What did we watch? All sorts of things. Lots of supernatural shows, particularly _Legacies_ and its ancestors. Recently, _Yellowstone_ and its offshoots. Further back, random DC Superhero shows. If I recall correctly, _Legends of Tomorrow_ and _Supergirl_ were some of her favorites. They were certainly less dark thank say, _Green Arrow_. A few sitcoms. We were watching _The Neighborhood_ the past few months. Also _Ghosts_ (both US and UK versions). Many others. I think I promised the kids a list, but that will come later. 

When she was sick of me asking questions, she'd turn on one of the shows that didn't usually need a backstory. Maybe a cooking show. Perhaps _Home Town_ or other house TV show. Perhaps _Judge Judy_ or some other legal show. Or perhaps one of the series she watched that I didn't. She made it through _The Sopranos_ over a few months. (Yes, she also watched TV when I wasn't watching.)

It's about five months since she died. I've barely watched TV since then. My background sound is now music, rather than TV. After all, there's barely anyone to watch with. I've watched some sporting events with Eldest. We've also watched some _Saturday Night Live_. Watching _SNL_ had been a family event. But we've made it through some episodes without her. When the boys and I were together during Winter break, we also watched some anime on Crunchyroll. Unfortunately, we weren't up to other holiday traditions, such as _A Year Without a Santa Claus_ or cheesy Hallmark Christmas movies [1,2]. 

I haven't completely ignored regular TV. A few weeks back, I watched a few episodes of _Ghosts_ (US version; I'm not sure that there are new episodes of the UK version). Something compelled me to go back to the begining of _Cheers_. I watched five or so episodes. What else? Perhaps that's about it.

Now that it's spring break, I find myself compelled to have more narrative material on in the background as I do my other kinds of work. Some of the smaller pieces of work don't require much attention. And grading is one of my tasks for break. Grading with TV sounds better when I am might be spending multiple hours a day on the TV.

So, what did I decide to watch? At first, I thought I'd try something new. I started with the random shows that appeared on the TV. _Yellowjackets_ is now in its third season, and, if I recall correctly, it has a supernatural theme. But when I looked for it, I learned that there was a second season of _School Spirits_. We watched the first season together. I thought I'd be comfortable trying the second season by myself. So far, I've been right.

[1] Is the "cheesy" redundant?

[2] I watched a cheesy Hallmark Hannukah movie or two by myself.
