There are many great things about working at Grinnell.  One that I
particularly appreciate is the availability of summer workshops
that build community and help us grow as teachers.  I try to attend
a few summer workshops each summer.  It's good to grow.  And I
always learn from doing things with my colleagues.  I also appreciate
that we get compensated for attending [1], although I also regularly
attend workshops for which I did not receive compensation.  But
it's nice to know that the administration acknowledges that extra
work deserves extra compensation [4].

But the compensation is not the point of this musing.  The workshops
are.  In most summers, I identify more workshops that I'd like to take
than I can ever hope to attend.  This summer, I need to take it easy
(or at least easier).  And I'm traveling a bit [5,6,7].  Let's consider
them in order.

Paula Smith and Dustin Dixon are teaching Workshop A, _Traditional
and New Ways of Teaching HUM 101_ [8].  I've never taught HUM-101,
_The Ancient Greek World_.  I'm unlikely to ever teach HUM-101.
But it would be kind of fun to teach it if I was allowed to.  I did
take _Greek Thought and Literature_ back when I was an undergrad
at UofC.  And it would be fun to learn from a thoughtful senior
colleague (Paula) and an awesome younger colleague (Dustin).
Unfortunately, the workshop is only open to those who've taught the
course recently or who are in the Humanities.  I'm not sure why
someone in, say, Studio Art, is any more qualified to teach the
course than the average liberally educated faculty member, but
that's their choice [10].  Also, it's the week that summer research
starts, and I don't want to schedule a workshop the week summer
research starts [12].

I also suppose that if I were going to do a workshop that week, I
would do workshop B, _Building a Cross Disciplinary Film and Media
Studies Concentration_, with Nicky Tavares and Lee Running.  I'd
like to support the new concentration.  I'd like to know more about
what they plan: Traditionally, Film and Media Studies focuses more
on the study of film and media than on the creation of film and
media; I seem to recall hearing that Grinnell's would emphasize
creation.  And I've already heard one colleague at another school
say "Be ready. At my school, Film and Media Studies has been a lot
like CS: rapid and sustained growth."  I also wonder whether the
workshop will include a discussion of what will happen with the
space designated for Film and Media Studies.  And, as I've said
before, I took a lot of film classes at UofC [14] and would like
to know more about how Film Studies is changing.  Oooh.  Maybe I
do want to participate.  Decisions.  Decisions.  Decisions.  Sorry,
Micki.  Sorry, students.  I'm still considering it.

The next week (June 7--11) brings us Workshop C, _Creating Inclusive
Learning Spaces: Feminism, Social Justice, and Belonging at Grinnell_
[15].  Once again, it's taught by two awesome faculty, John Garrison
and Carolyn Herbst Lewis [16].  And it's an important topic.  But I've
taken similar workshops before and, um, I think I'm scheduled to do
grading for AP CS Principles that week [17].

The following week (June 14--18) brings us Workshop D, _An Introduction
to ArcGIS and StoryMaps_, with Gina Donovan and Tierney [18]
Steelberg.  One of my best friends works for ESRI, yet I've never
learned ArcGIS.  I've liked the courses I've taken from Gina before.
I'd like to get to know our newest Digital Liberal Arts Specialist [19].
But I'm cutting.  So no on this one.

The week of June 21 brings a workshop I was planning to co-lead at
one point or another, Workshop E, _Revisiting Grading: For Sanity,
Transparency, and Equity_.  Okay, I was planning on working with
PM on an Equitable Grading workshop; I believe this one merges two
related workshops.  It's being run by some awesome people [20],
including not only Peter-Michael Osera, but also Susan Ferguson,
Cynthia Hansen, and Vanessa Preast.  All else being equal, this
would be my top workshop.  But I may be on vacation for part of the
week.  And mornings are supposed to be devoted to my research
students.  Perhaps I'll sneak into the workshop off and on without
registering formally.

The week of June 28 brings us Workshop F, _Digital Storytelling_,
with Gina Donovan.  As I've said, I learn a lot from Gina.  But it
sounds like this is primarily a skills development workshop, and
digital storytelling is not a skill I particularly care to develop
at this point in my career.  Also, I'm unlikely to be available this
week.

The same week brings us Workshop G, _Commenting on (Multilingual)
Student Writing_, with Tisha Turk and Erin Todey [21,23].  Tisha's
been an amazing addition to Grinnell [24].  And I've learned something
from Erin every time that we've talked.  So this would be fun and
valuable.  Nonetheless, I think it falls in the "Not this year"
category because (a) I'll be away for part of the week and (b) I'm
not teaching much writing next year [25].  I also spent a workshop
day with Tisha and Erin on these issues last summer.

Tisha is busy with workshops this summer.  The following week, she's
running Workshop H, _Assessing Student Writing: Reflection and Next
Steps_, along with Taylor Price.  I spent at least three summers,
and perhaps more, participating in summer writing assessment
workshops.  I have such fond memories of those workshops.  I learned
a lot in those, particularly early in my career when I got to compare
my grading of papers to those of experienced faculty like Kent
McClelland and Paula Smith.  I also got to meet new faculty in those
workshops; I remember when Cori Jakubiak participated before she'd
even started at Grinnell [27].  And I saw the evolution of our
writing assessment, from a time when we gathered papers early and
late in student careers but without the assignments, to a much more
focused strategy that included not just the assignments, but the
students reflecting on their growth [28].  And I care about assessment.
Damn!  Another tempting one.  Choosing was much easier before I
decided to muse about all of them.  But I'm just back from vacation
and my students deserve my time.  So, although it's painful to write
it, this is probably a no.

Marching onward, I see that the following week (July 12--15) has
Workshop I, _Living \[O\]ur Values: Grinnell's First-Year Experience
Course_.  I did this workshop last summer.  It was wonderful.  I
learned a lot.  I'd recommend it to everyone.  But I've done it
already.  So, while it might be fun to do again, it's low on my
priority list.  And just in case you're worried about it, I'm not 
planning to teach FYEC this coming spring.

Workshop J, _Tutorial Instructors_, is another workshop I did last
summer.  It's also probably not available to me, since I'm not
teaching Tutorial this fall [29].  Paul Hutchison and Carolyn
Jacobson, two awesome colleagues, are running it again.  I encourage
everyone who is teaching Tutorial to take it.

Workshop K, _Unteaching Racism: Understanding and Handling Misuse
of Racial Categories_ is being offered by Leslie Gregg-Jolly and
Katya Gibel-Mevorach during the week of July 26-28.  It sounds like
this is an extension of their popular _Racing Genetics_ course.  I
relish the opportunity to take a workshop with "Professor Katya"
and my good friend in biology.  Plus, it's an incredibly important
topic in these times, and I expect that Leslie and Katya will present
some importantly different perspectives.  I think this is the winner!

Workshop L, _Becoming a Story Spotter_ is being offered by folk
from Communications: Michele Regenold, Justin Hayworth, Dayna Jensen,
and Mattia Wells.  I'm glad that Communications is reaching out to
collaborate with faculty and staff on developing stories.  I don't
know most of these folks well, except for Justin, who is an awesome
photographer.  But I'm not doing two workshops in one week, and
Workshop K has already been identified as the winner.

Vanessa Preast is offering Workshop M, _Survey Says!  Creating
Qualtrics Surveys_ , at some unknown date.  I know enough about
Qualtrics to be dangerous.  Would this help me learn more?  Probably.
But I'd prefer to learn things on demand.  I'll ask Vanessa for the
materials.  I hope she reminds people that "Submit" and "Next"
buttons should be different [30].

David Perez and Taylor Price from the writing lab are running Workshop
N, _Rewriting the Reading Assignment_, the week of August 2--6.  It
even comes with a free book, and it may be in person.  That's
tempting; just the opportunity to be with other faculty would be
great.  And I like being the challenging outsider, "Reading a CS/Math
book is different than reading other books; what do you recommend
for me?"  But it's the last week of summer research.  Maybe I'll take
a look at the book on my own.

If that weren't enough for the week, Mo Pelzel and Tierney Steelberg
are running Workshop O, _Home on the Web: Using Web Domains and
Sites for Teaching, Scholarship, and Professional Development_ [31],
the same week.  I'm pretty good at creating Web sites and having
students create Web sites; I've been doing so since 1995.  If I
attended, I'd likely end up being a troublemaker ("I don't want my
students to use some crappy site builder; they should write raw
HTML/CSS.").  So it's probably best that I not attend, even if I'd
likely learn some new uses of the Web, as I always learn from Mo.
Also, it's the last week of summer research [32].

NSO [33] begins on August 20 and classes begin on August 26, so
you might think we'd have exhausted the summer workshops. Nonetheless,
there are still three more to go [34].

Todd Armstrong is offering Workshop P, _A Global Kitchen in the
Liberal Arts_, the week of August 9--12.  Todd's made great use of
cooking in his classes, from a Tutorial to an evening class or
Russian culture.  I also think Todd was a driving force behind the
Global Kitchen in the HSSC.  Computer science has many ties to
cooking and recipes; both are about writing instructions for others
to follow.  I could lead some discussions about how you write
algorithmic recipes for different audiences. But I'm spending the
week after summer research with Michelle.  No workshops for me!

That also means that I won't be at Workshop Q, _Restorative Practices
Circle Facilitation Training_, with our Ombuds, Chinyere Ukabiala,
and Brigittine French.  I've so appreciated the circle sessions
I've been to this year; I'd call them more "community building"
than "restorative practices", but both goals are important and
likely overlap.  I'd place this only slightly below the equitable
grading workshop in my priority list.  But no, I"m spending my week
with Michelle.  This one doesn't even warrant a second consideration.
I hope lots of others will attend and that we'll offer this workshop
again another summer.

Finally, Workshop R is _Writing and Research Assignments (for new
faculty)_, taught by Tisha Turk and Phil Jones.  This one is offered
the same week as NFO [35].  The last time I checked, this fall will
be my twenty-fifth fall at Grinnell.  I think that means that I'm not
the audience.  And this is likely another one where my curmudgeonly
personality would arise: "In the sciences, Library Research is not 
what we generally mean by 'Research'", or something like that [36].

I feel fortunate to be at an institution which supports such a
variety of interesting workshop and which attracts such wonderful
colleagues to lead the workshops.  I wish I could take more.  Perhaps
I should take a summer off and just take workshops.  But no, if I
take a summer off, it should be to live with my wonderful wife in
the far-off town that Oughta Bin.

That's enough musing for today.  But I mustn't forget to submit
my preferences.  And if you're a Grinnell faculty/staff member,
you should, too!

---

[1] "We" is an awkward word here.  Faculty on nine-month contracts [2]
receive compensation for attending summer workshops.  Faculty on
twelve-month contracts, as well as most staff, do not receive compensation.
Most faculty and staff who attend workshops believe *everyone* who attends
the workshops should get the same compensation [3].  But HR is, well, HR.
At least that's what I'm told.

[2] Most of the faculty, with the exception of the library faculty and,
perhaps, some others.

[3] Those who design and run workshops deserve more.  And yes, they
receive it.

[4] It would be nicer if the administration acknowledged that summer
workshops are still extra work for those on eleven-month and
twelve-month contracts.

[5] Yes, that's part of "take it easy".

[6] Don't worry, GC Administration.  I'm fully immunized.  I don't plan
to be anywhere crowded.  And I'm not traveling on College business.

[7] Don't worry, GC Administration.  I'm making plans for my summer
students when I'm out of town.

[8] Aren't we supposed to hyphenate course numbers?  [9]

[9] I'll admit that I've rarely been consistent in how I write course
numbers.  There are times I would have written it as "HUM101".  There are
times I would have written it as "HUM 101".  These days, I include the
hyphen at least in most cases.

[10] Or maybe it's their funding agency's choice; it's supported by our
Mellon Humanities In Action [11] grant.

[11] No offense intended, but am I the only one who worries about the
misreading of this title?

[12] It wouldn't have stopped me in prior years, but I'm trying to be
more sensible.

[14] Both as an undergrad and as a graduate student.

[15] Yay, love to see Oxford Commas in workshop titles.

[16] I forget whether Carolyn prefers "Carolyn Lewis", as it's listed,
or "Carolyn Herbst Lewis", as I think of her.

[17] Yes, I realize that my version of taking it easy is different
than other people's.  But there's a brand new version of the AP CS
Principles exam and I want to learn about it and the new rubric.  AP
Grading is also a comparatively low-stress activity.

[18] Otter.ai likes to call Tierney "Tyranny".  Yay, AI!

[19] Or whatever title that position has morphed into.

[20] Maybe I need to stop calling the workshop leaders awesome; it
seems that the odds that the workshop leaders are awesome is close to
100%.

[21] Misspelled as "Today" in the form.  Probably a case of autocorrect
[22].  Am I the only one who notices such things?

[22] Grammarly also wants me to change "Todey" to "Today".

[23] My brain isn't working today.  Now I'm trying to remember how
to pronounce "Todey".  I think it's "Todd-ee".  Forgive me, Erin.
All I remember is "Tah Dah!".

[24] Of course, our prior writing lab directors were also awesome.

[25] Or maybe I am.  My schedule is not yet set.  There's a chance I'll
be teaching a course on ethics and inclusion in computing [26].

[26] I need to write the long-overdue proposal for that course, but
that's awaiting a lot of other departmental decisions.  I don't
want to spend time on the proposal unless I know I'll be teaching
the course.

[27] Cori's tenured now.  It's hard to believe.  They grow up so fast.

[28] Or am I misremembering?

[29] I'm not even sure when or if I'll ever get to teach Tutorial again.

[30] Too many surveys at Grinnell use an arrow for both "Next" and "Submit".
The arrow should not be used for "Submit".  And shame on Qualtrics for
making the arrow the default button symbol.

[31] Whoo!  More Oxford commas.

[32] Well, it's the last week of my summer research program, which starts
on June 1.  I think we're allowed to start a week or two later, which means
that the ten weeks end a week or two later.

[33] New Student Orientation.

[34] Or maybe four, if Workshop M gets scheduled in mid-August.

[35] New Faculty Orientation.

[36] There are a host of issues that make me curmudgeonly about how
we use the term "research".
