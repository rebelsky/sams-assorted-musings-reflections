Like, well, everyone else, I've found work life in a pandemic
different.  At Grinnell, some things are getting closer to normal.
For example, we once again have in-person classes, and we have had
them all year.  We're also back to semesters after the accelerated
horror of terms.  Of course, students are masked and I have a
rotating cast of students who are in isolation.  But it's closer
to normal, at least in that sense.

My professional service also doesn't feel much different.  It's
conducted online, but much of it has always been conducted remotely.
Perhaps I'm more adept at it than I was a few years ago, but meeting
online is meeting online, and meeting online is necessary when
participants are physically distant.

The rest of my job feels a lot different [1].  One of the best parts
of being a faculty member is the people.  And I see people at places
like talks and meetings and the lunchroom.  And, well, faculty
meetings are online, talks are too [2], and faculty and staff have
been banned from the Marketplace.  So I don't get the opportunity
for those quick greetings and comments that happen at such places.
I also prefer in-person talks because I feel more engaged.

So today felt special.  When the Campus Memo came out [3], I saw
that a department was hosting what sounded like an interesting talk
today [4].  I rearranged my schedule to attend.  It was, indeed, a
good talk.  Perhaps even a great one.  Unfortunately, it wasn't
particularly well attended: A few students, a few faculty from the
hosting department, someone videotaping, and me.  But it was great
to chat with colleagues.  

I'd also forgotten how nice live, in-person talks are; I don't feel
like it would have been the same remotely [5].  Seeing the whole
person and not just a talking head also makes the talk better.  I
even got to ask a question and make a funny comment [6].  It was
special.

Perhaps we can soon return to the days in which such experiences are
normal, rather than special.

I wish I were more optimistic about that "soon" part.

[1] Teaching does, too, in case that wasn't clear.

[2] For some reason, Grinnell generally doesn't permit side chats at talks.

[3] The electronic version, which is not as much fun as the goldenrod
memo or its calendar-like predecessor.

[4] Nope, I'm not saying which one.  If you figure it out, you'll understand
why.

[5] "Virtually", in current SIGCSE parlance.

[6] At least I thought it was funny.
