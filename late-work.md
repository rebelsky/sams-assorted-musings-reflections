The other day, a colleague posted something like the following question to Facebook.

> It had to happen eventually....a couple students who stopped submitting work basically a month ago, now up and decide to submit said all work, including a final take home exam, 4 DAYS after the due date.

We've all had problems like these. I'll admit that, now that I'm an older (and somewhat curmudgeonly) faculty member, I respond somewhat differently than I did as a younger (still curmudgeonly) faculty member. Here's a modified version of what I wrote in reply.

> Hope springs eternal.

> More seriously, we don't know everything that's going on in students' lives. Some of our students don't have good executive function (but are working on it). Some of our students have had tragedies in their lives. Some have been ill but haven't let us know. So many things could be going on. In situations like these, I try to balance what I think is fair, what my workload will be (we have to take care of ourselves), and what I know or have heard. Sometimes I ask one of my amazing colleagues in academic advising for advice.

> Another issue is that this kind of last-minute work is more likely to involve some failings of academic integrity, which means that actually grading the work may be worse for the student.
