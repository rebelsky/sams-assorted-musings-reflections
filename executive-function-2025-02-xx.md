Michelle served many roles in life and in our family. Doctor, confidant, wife, mother, friend, mentor, more. I can't hope to describe them all. However, as time passes, I find myself compelled to describe some of those roles. Right now, I've been reflecting on how she served as the "executive function" of the family.

I don't think "executive function" is a term normally applied to families. I most frequently hear it applied to students who struggle to keep themselves on track. Such students might forget work, neglect to think about how their different responsibilities will conflict, fail to plan for the future, miss meetings, and so on and so forth.

It seems to me that Michelle served similar roles for our family. She was the one who usually said "It's time to pay the bills." I might be the one who ended up paying the bills, but she was the one tasked with reminding me. Fortunately, most of our bills are on auto-pay. She was the one who'd say "This room might look better if we rearranged it." Or the one to suggest that was time to clean out a cabinet. Or organize our sheets and towels. Or, to suggest something larger, to plan a family vacation.

It's not that we didn't all have roles to play in the life of the family. As I said, I often ended up paying the bills. I think everyone in the immediately family ended up balacing our checkbook at least once. I tended to keep up with ensuring that we had groceries in the house and using those groceries to feed us [1]. Everyone pitched in for cleaning, rearranging, and such.

Nonethless, she took the lead role. 

Blah blah blah.

[1] Michelle would, at times, suggest that I think more carefully about my purchases. I think she'd be happy to see that I'm avoiding purchasing sweets and that our cabinets and fridge aren't overflowing.
