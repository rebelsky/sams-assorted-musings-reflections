It's Thanksgiving.  Two nights ago, the third of my three sons to
come home for the holiday made it home.  We sat around in the living
room talking for a few hours [1].  It was a normal Rebelsky
conversation, touching on a variety of issues, using a variety of
dialects [2], and including the normal amount of jabs at each other.
We shared things we are doing [3], joys, and frustrations.  It made
me so damn happy.  I love the times we can be together, just talking.

With three children in three parts of the country, and with Michelle
spending half her week in birdland [4], it's getting harder to get
us all together at the same time.  Soon, they'll have more significant
lives of their own, and it will be harder to get all of us together.
But it will happen.

In any case, I felt so thankful to be together as a family.  I
remain thankful two days later.  I'm thankful that we got to hold
another session of the legendary Rebelsky book club [5,7].  As
always, I pushed the deadline for getting things read [8], and
didn't quite finish until midway through the discussion.  I'm even
thankful that we binge watched TV together [10]; it's warming to
be together in the same room.

I'm also thankful that my brother- and sister-in-law are driving
in for dinner.  It's good to get the expanded family together
even if the family does not expand all that much.

All this thankfulness, as well as the problematic holiday we are
together for, has me thinking about other things I'm thankful for.

As I told my students yesterday, I'm thankful for in-person teaching
and for the awesome young adults who I get to teach.

I'm damn thankful to be alive.  I need to treat myself better so I
stay that way.  And I need to do so sooner, rather than later [11].

I am thankful for the people around me: Not just family and students,
but friends, colleagues, folks I communicate with online [14], and
more.

I've always enjoyed music.  The pandemic led a number of great
artists to take their live performances online.  While there are
times that I feel overwhelmed by the number of shows I can see, and
there are other times I worry that I'm not supporting artists well
enough financially or through appropriate attention, I am so thankful
that I get to experience live music regularly, that I've found new
musicians to appreciate, and that I've even become friends of sorts
with some of these musicians.

In the end, I'm most thankful about those closest to me, my amazing
and thoughtful and tolerant wife and the three young men who fill
me with pride.

I hope my readers all have things for which they are thankful.

If we ignore all of the complications associated with Thanksgiving,
perhaps we can appreciate a holiday whose primary goal should be to
embrace thankfulness.

[1] Not the best idea for me, given that I need a lot of sleep and
I had to teach the next morning.

[2] Two of my children appear to dispute the great vowel shift.

[3] Or not doing.

[4] My new name for "Audubon".

[5] Middle chose book five of the Cradle series, which required us
to read the previous books.  I'm still not sure how I feel about
the series [6].

[6] It doesn't matter how I feel.  The next book is book ten of the
series along with an expectation that we'll read the intervening
books.  At least I get to pick the following book.

[7] At some point, I'll remember to make a list of all the books
we've read.

[8] I look forward to next academic year, when I should have more
time for reading [9].

[9] And exercising and thinking and more.

[10] Binge watching often involves other simultaneous things, such as
conversations or, in my case, playing on the computer.

[11] I'd been doing well, but now I'm "back sliding away" [12].

[12] I realize that the Paul Simon song goes "slip sliding away".  I
appreciate the variant.

[14] Some of them call themselves FANily because we share appreciation
of some musical artists.
