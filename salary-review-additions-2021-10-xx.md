Almost immediately after I posted my long and rambly musings on
[my triennial salary review](salary-review-2021-10-23) and 
[my initial encounters with the horror known as Interfolio](worse-than-sedona-2021-10-23), I realized that there was even more to write, both about
the salary review process and, more importantly, for the salary review
document.  In this musing, I add a few notes.

I'm proud of the work I did on `rex`, the regular-expression library
for our introductory course.  I think it makes regular expressions
more comprehensible to introductory students.  Of course, almost
anything would be more comprehensible for introductory students
than the standard notation for regular expressions.  Making further
progress on the library seems like a good use of my time.  So I
added a second paragraph under "Scholarship".

> Part of the software I've developed for our new introductory
classes may be useful to others, because it frames an important
standard topic in a new way, one more amenable to use by novices.
I hope to further extend that library, port it to other languages,
and write something about it.  I am also likely to write something
about our new Digital Humanities version of the introductory course.

At some point, I started thinking about the musings themselves.  They
are part of what I do.  They have effects, both positive and negative.
Mostly positive.  I hope.  So I added a note to the "Other" section.

> As you likely know, I have written a 'blog about various aspects
of Grinnell and academic life over the past five or so years.  Many
students tell me that they appreciate reading them and that they
read them as prospective students.  Alumni tell me that the posts
keep them connected to Grinnell.  I've also started to receive notes
from parents of current and prospective students, who tell me that
they appreciate the additional information and perspectives on the
institution.  I have no idea what you should do with this information,
but I thought you should have it.

Hmmm.  I wonder if "Muse" can be my SFS project.
