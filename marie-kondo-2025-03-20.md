The location: The Rebelsky household.

Scenario: My offspring have hired Marie Kondo to help with decluttering.

We join our story in the middle.

MK holds up a piece of paper that appears to be an old shopping list.

_Does this spark joy?_

> Yes. 

_Really?_

> Yes. I remember that shopping expedition. Afterwards, I stopped and had a milkshake at Cunningham's, back when we had Cunninghams.

MK holds up a copy of _The Princess Bride_.

_Does this spark joy?_

> Yes.

_You have ten copies. All of them can't spark joy!_

> Each is different. This one is one of the printings with a fold-out cover. That one comes from after the movie was released. This one has notes in it from when I was reading it the first time. The hardcover has illustrations. All of them spark joy.

MK holds up a few more copies.

_And these others?_

> Oh. Those are for loaning to people.

_Why do those spark joy?_

> I envision the happiness people get when the read the book for the first time. Or even the second time.

MK holds up a crumpled candy wrapper.

_This can't spark joy. Let's toss it._

> But it's from Goldenberg's Peanut Chews! I remember that my grandmother used to keep those on her counter when I visited her in New York. And you can't get them in Iowa any more. I thought they might be available in Pennsylvania, but I forgot to go shopping when I was in Pittsburgh. And, arguably, I should't put peanut products in our house.

MK points to a neat but large pile of approximately 1,217 boxes of Crayola Crayons?

_One box, maybe. Even thirty two because "I want to use them in my class." But this many boxes? They can't bring you joy!_

> Have you not heard about the power of multiples? Think of Ai Weiwei's _Sunflower Seeds_! Also, I have some great ideas about physical pixel art. Looking ahead to those brings me joy.

We think we hear MK say "oy" in response. But she's not Jewish. Confusing.

_You appear to have a few thousand small wooden chicken legs that look like they are designed for a board game. Perhaps "Stone Age"._

> Did you not hear me say "multiples"? I have another project vaguely in mind. And it's 3,000, if I count correctly.

MK holds up another something unrecognizable.

_I suppose this also sparks joy?_

> You found it! Of course a tab from a band-aid sparks joy. It reminds me of the caregiving I did for Michelle. Or the caregiving she did for me. Some combination thereof. Wait a minute, let me find a display box for it.

_I feel so sorry for your family._

**_Some followup comments_**

Even though so many things spark joy in my life, I'm still sad a lot of the time. Is that why I look for so many things to spark joy?

On that note: This musing was inspired by an Interweb meme about a depressed person meeting Marie Kondo and throwing out everything in their house because nothing sparked joy.

Yes, I once had 1000+ boxes of crayons (24 count). Or some absurdly large number. I gave a bunch to a student who was doing an art project of their own. I got rid of most of the rest back when the Marshalltown school district was collecting school supplies. Each fall, I consider resupplying myself when they're on sale.

No, I don't really have part of a band-aid around to remind me of Michelle. But many items raise joy because I associate them with people I love. And like my comment about the band-aid tab, I'm not always coherent about it. 

I'm also pretty sure that I threw out all my Goldenberg's wrappers. But I may have kept one movie-theatre box (empty). It's also not necessary to drive to Pennsylvania to get them; you can order them online.
