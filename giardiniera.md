The other day, I decided to make a large batch of Chicago-style giardiniera? "What's giardiniera?", you may ask? Traditional giardiniera is chunks of pickled vegetables, such as carrots, cauliflower, and celery. You can use vegetables that don't start with c, too. It's often served as an antipasto. Like many things, giardiniera changed when it hit the new world, or at least when it hit Chicago. In Chicago, giardiniera ends up being very small pieces of pickled vegetables, often mixed into oil. It's a key ingredient in Italian Beef sandwiches (at least Chicago-stuyle Italian Beef sandwiches). William and I enjoy it on many kinds of sandwiches.

It used to be that you could buy reasonably good Chicago-style giardiniera locally; both Hy-Vee and Walmart carried Mezzetta Chicago-style giardiniera, but mild and hot. But they stopped. I'm not sure why. When I remember, I pick it up at Hy-Vee stores in other towns, which still seem to carry it. But I forget. And it seems to have gotten more expensive at Hy-Vee. I tried ordering from Amazon, but they sent me Italian-style instead (the big chunks), and boy was it salty. I had an adventure trying to return it, since they don't allow returns on foodstuffs. I ended up having to keep it, but getting a refund.

In any case, I decided to make giardiniera. It's fun to make things yourself. I made it a few months ago as well as a year or two ago. I'm about done with the stuff a made a few months ago, so it was time to make some more.

For the first batch I made, I followed [the recipe from Chili Papper Madness](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/recipes/giardiniera/). It's designed to be adapted, so I can't say that I followed it exactly. And I made a huge container. It was good.

I made a more reasonable amount the second time; about 32 oz. That time, I let the vegetables brine for a week. I also used one of the jars of Italian-style giardiniera as part of the mix, cutting the veggies up smaller (and rinsing them off). I was very happy with the results.

Here's what I used this time.

* One head of celery.
* One pound of carrots.
* Two large red onions.
* One pound of small sweet peppers (red and orange).
* Four 4-ounce jars of roasted jalape√±os.
* Two jars of Mezetta hot Italian-style giardiniera.

I cut everything up into small pieces, layering it into a jar. I salted each layer as I went.

After filling the container with water, I let it sit in the fridge for a week.

Then I rinsed it out and mixed everything up. I added ....

I wasn't sure if William likes olives, so I split it.

Yum!

**_Postscript_**: If I recall correctly, Pete's, our go-to hot-dog stand, uses Alpino hot giardiniera (at least if you ask for hot).
