_Warning: As is the norm for the preregistration musings, this musing has not been edited or checked for accuracy._

The first stage of preregistration [1] for Spring 2026 just finished. It's been fairly long since I've mused about prereg, so it seems like an opportune time to do so again. After all, I like to look at data. And, at times, it helps me be a better advisor. It may also tell me new things about Grinnell.

For those who don't know Grinnell, Grinnell has an atypical registration system. Rather than, say, using a first-come, first served registration process or a staggered process [2], Grinnell lets students "register" for the classes they'd like to take without consideration of limits on class sizes. After that, there's a process by which we cut classes back to their limits. After that, students who've been cut add new classes from what's still available, often on a first-come, first-served basis.

Back when I started at Grinnell, the period after preliminary registration was called "cut, close, and balance". You see, if a class had too many students, we'd see if there was another section of the same class that we could shift those students into, even if it met at another time or had a different instructor. We'd do that even if a class wasn't over-enrolled; it generally makes more sense to have two classes of fifteen students than, say, a class of twenty-four and a class of six. However, a variety of factors led us to eliminate the balancing procedure. It required a lot of labor by the staff in the Registrar's office. It meant that students might not end up with the instructor or time that they preferred. Some administrators thought the latter issue was unfair. As I've noted in the past, it was often a question of whether you prioritize group fairness or individual fairness.

These days, cutting is done using a priority system. For each class, departments set priorities. For example, it might prioritize students in certain majors or class years. Here's the standard priority for upper-division computer science courses.

> CSC: 4th, 3rd, 2nd (only prioritized for 1 CSC course per sem unless need <1 in grad sem)

Here's a more complex structure for PHY-220, _Electronics_ [7].

> PHY 4th, 3rd, 2nd; BIO/CHM/BCM 4th, 3rd, 2nd; other 4th, 3rd

Here's an even more complex (or at least longer) one for MAT-220, _Differential Equations_.

> 3rd taking w/ PHY 234, 2nd, 3rd MAT/PHY, 4th MAT, 1st, 3rd CHM/BIO/BCM/ENV, 4th, 3rd

Of course, most are much simpler. Such ANT-210, _Illness, Healing, and Culture_ (ANT, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) or ANT-280, _Theories of Culture_, which reverses the list (ANT, 4th, 3rd, 2nd).

As I noted, we've just finished the first stage. That is, students have "registered" for classes. We're about to move into the cutting stage. This provides an oppotune time to look at the preliminary choices students have made. That can be useful for scheduling classes in the future, for advising ("It's nice that you'd like to take Underwater Basket Weaving; unfortunately, past history suggests that about three times as many students preregister for the course as can take the course; let's consider a fallback."), and perhaps to learn something about particularly popular faculty or courses.

I used to enjoy hypothesizing about whether all the preregistered students would be able to get certain classes and how students might ensure that. For example, I'd try to predict whether a department would choose to balance and whether the Dean would approve an extra section or lab. These days, I find such explorations less interesting, particularly since we've lost the balancing. Hence, I tend to focus more on things that catch my eye.

Here goes.

I like to start with the most popular classes. Or at least the most heavily enrolled. And I suppose I mean "sections" rather than "classes" (or at least rather than "courses") [8].

I had anticipated the Fernanda Eliott's CSC-261, _Artificial Intelligence_, would be at the top of the list. Certainly, most of my advisees wanted to enroll. And there are a lot of CS majors. Plus, AI is a hot topic these days. While it has a large enrollment (37, with a capacity of 24), it's relatively far down on the popular classes list.

At the top? Section 2 of STA-209, _Applied Statistics_, with 56 students preregistered. I think Collin Nolte, who is teaching that course, may have the highest number of students preregistered overall, with 56 in that, 45 in Section one of 209, and another 33 in STA-230, _Data Science_. It reminds me of the days in which President Osgood would announce the faculty who taught the most students in the graduating class, and Tom Moore would inevitably be one of them.

Although Collin's class has the most preregistered students, it is not the most over-enrolled class. STA-209 permits 26 students, so that section is only over-enrolled by 30. In contrast, Christy Hazel's MAT-215-02, _Linear Algebra_, has 54 enrolled and a cap of 20, making it over-enroled by 34 students. She didn't quite reach the factor-of-three ratio of my fantasized UBW [9] course, but it's close.

I suppose it's worth imagining the CCB [10] process for each of these two classes, even if we no longer have such a process. Let's see ... there are 177 students preregistered for STA-209. There are six sections, each with a capacity of 26. That would permit 156 students. Amazingly, they could probably use another section.

Hmmm. My students often need 209. I wonder what the priority policies for that class are.  Damn! It's "2nd, 1st, 3rd, 4th". I suppose we should be encouraging our students to take that before they declare their CS major. Or perhaps we need to do some horse trading with Statistics to help each other with priorities.

What about Linear Algebra?  There are 85 students preregistered and the four sections provide room for 80 of them. In the old days, we would likely have permitted the sections to over-enroll. I wonder what Math will do this year.

As long as we're on courses from the former Department of Mathematics and Statistics (now the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics), let's see what other over-enrollment troubles they face. MAT-321-01, _Foundations of Abstract Algebra_, has 32 students preenrolled in a course that has a capacity of 20. Too bad for the non-math students who take Abstract for funsies! Or maybe Math will find a way to add a second section. For example, they could theoretically cut one of the sections of Calc II and still meet demand. That would free someone up to teach another section of 321.

MAT-220-01, _Differential Equations_, has 39 students and a cap of 28. I guess the Registrar's office will get to implement the complex priority structure for that class.

STA-230, _Introduction to Data Science_, in over-enrolled by 21 seats between the two sections. One of those is Collin Nolte's, with a cap of 18 and a preenrollment of 33. It would be nice to offer a third section. I don't think Stats can cut anything to achieve that goal, so some complex back-room shenanigans would likely have to happen to handle the demand for 230 or 209. 

In any case, I'm glad Stats was approved for an expansion position.

STA-310-01, _Statistical Modeling_, is also overenrolled. Fortunately, there seem to be enough slots in STA-310-02. That section is just in the less-pleasant time of TuTh 8:30-9:50 a.m.

Crap! STA-340-01, _Baysian Statistics_, has twenty-five students preenrolled and a capacity of twelve. I expect that all of those preenrolled students are Stats concentrators who need it for their concentration. And there's not really another 300-level statistics class with space to push them into. There are five slots on STA-309, _Design and Analysis of Experiments_, but I believe that meets a different requirement for the concentration. (Sam pauses to check the requirements.) Nope. I'm wrong. STA-340 and STA-309 both meet the "eight credits of advanced courses" requirement. So I suppose the students can mostly be pushed to 309 and 310. It will just be tight.

If you're reading this and aren't a faculty member, you're probably asking yourself questions like "_Why don't they just increase the capacity of the course?_" or "_Why don't they just add another section?_" If you're the parent of a student who is cut from one of these courses, or a student cut, you are almost certainly asking these questions.

I have answers. I'm not sure they'll be satisfactory, but I have answers.

Why don't we normally permit classes to over-enroll? When we over-enroll a class, we often have to change the pedagogy. Most frequently, that means that we have to move from active learning in the classroom to more lecture-based teaching. And that's worse for students. The individual attention students receive is also likely to go down. After all, we have limited time in our days. A few extra students claming office-hour time may mean that others get no time. Adding students also increases our workload. We have more questions to answer, more work to grade, more people to keep track of.

We also encounter the "slippery slope" problem. If you'll allow a course to over-enroll by one or two students, why not three or four? If three or four, why not five or six? "It's just a few more."

Unfortunately, there are also political reasons not to allow classes to over-enroll. If we handle the demand internally, administrators are less likely to understand our stress and pain. And that makes a difference when we ask for more faculty. "We're constantly overworked, with more demand than we can handle." "I don't see the problem; you seem to be accomodating all interested students." However, if we stick to our class capacities, we shift some of the pain elsewhere. Students (and their parents) complain not just to us, but also to administrators. And that gives those administrators incentive to help us better address the problem.

Students shouldn't be pawns in a game between departments and the administration. Unfortunately, institutional behavior often leads things in that direction.

What about adding new sections? To add new sections, we need people to teach those sections. If we don't cut a section elsewhere, it's not clear where those people come from. Should a faculty member move from five classes per year to six? That will likely have extreme negative consequences on the attention they can give students, on their scholarship, and on their personal lives. Can't we just find someone else to teach the classes? Unfortunately, Grinnell is a small town; there isn't a large cadre of people who are qualified to teach courses, who want to teach courses, and can do the quality of teaching the Grinnell expects. If there is a cadre at all, it's very small, and only qualified in a few subjects.

In addition, although Grinnell has an insanely large endowment, so much of our base budget comes from the endowment that it's hard to come up with the money to add extra courses, or at least that's what I hear. The Dean manages when they can and we can find extra people, but they hope to find other solutions.

As I've mentioned, one solution is to cut other courses. That only works in restricted circumstances. You can't for example, cut a section of CSC-151 and magically switch a faculty member to teach STA-230. In some departments, perhaps most, you can't even cut one upper-level course and switch that faculty member to another upper-level course. For example, you wouldn't expect a faculty member whose expertise is in 19th-century American history to be able to teach a section of the popular Medieval history course.

Finally, as one of our Deans used to tell me, there are a host of other courses offered at Grinnell that are not over-enrolled. In most cases, students will benefit just as much (if not more) from those courses as they would benefit from the courses they've had to drop. And they can usually get their desired course in another semester.

Where was I before I explored adding courses or capacity? Oh, that's right. Some upper-level classes Stats classes are over-enrolled and there isn't enough room for students to swap to other upper-level stats classes. I recall when CS felt like this, or perhaps even worse. Fortunately, we had a fallback: We would often restrict students to one CS course per semester (unless they needed more than one to make appropriate progress toward graduation). I don't think Stats can invoke that approach; most Stats concentrators only take one Stats course per semester. I wish them luck.

Speaking of CS, let's look at how we're doing. It's a mixed bag.

At the upper levels, things are fairly tight. I've already noted that AI has 37 students preregistered. Fernanda (or perhaps the department) was generous, and the capacity for that course is 24, so only thirteen students will need to find another course. Since AI is an elective, that course is not strictly necessary. Still, I'd prefer that we make sure that all students can take courses they want to take.

CSC-324-01, _Software Design_, is over-enrolled by fourteen students and CSC-324-02 is over-enrolled by three. I know that we generaly permit the class to grow a bit, so that may cover as many as eight or so of those seventeen. The remaining nine or more? There are six slots in CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_ [11]. There are nine slots in CSC-313, _Advanced Operating Systems_, but that's an elective and has some additional prerequisites. There are also a bunch of slots in CSC-211, _Computer Architecture_.

At the other end of the curriculum, and the other end of the CS enrollment spectrum, we have CSC-151. We only have 28 students enrolled across three sections. Historically, it's closer to 70. I expect that a variety of factors are at play.  One is that the job path for a CS major has become much less clear. It used to be that CS provided a fairly straightforward path to a well-paying career. That's no longer the case. Not all of our majors chose CS because of the career options, but some did. Certainly, many schools are seeing fairly significant decreases in the number of students declaring CS majors. Another is that we offered four sections, rather than three, in the fall. Hence, there isn't a group of students who were cut. I believe the class of 2029 is a comparatively small class (421 students, compared to the "nearly 1800 students" enrolled at the College) and has about 20% fewer international students. The interactive development environment we use for the course has also had more problems than normal this semester, which may make the class seem less attractive. And, perhaps, students who wanted CSC-151 mostly to learn programming basics have decided that generative AI can do all they need. I hope they don't believe that. They shouldn't. But GenAI gets a lot of hype, particularly for doing basic programming tasks.

[1] Belinda has now officially termed it "Preliminary Registration".

[2] Staggered processes often involve seniors registering first, then third-years [3], then second-years [4], and, finally, freshlings [5,6].

[3] Third-year students are "juniors" at most institutions. We don't call third-year students "juniors" because, um, it implies being lesser. Something like that.

[4] Second-year students are "sophomores" at most institutions. We don't call second-year students "sophomores" because the term is derogatory. Or perhaps it's because more than the second-year class act sohpomoric.

[5] "Freshling" is my term for first-year student.

[6] Many institutions call first-year students "Freshmen". That term is gendered.

[7] I'm puzzled why CS isn't on that list. We may need to revisit some agreements with Physics.

[8] The difference between "class" and "course" confuses me.

[9] Underwater Basket Weaving.

[10] Cut, Close, and Balance.

[11] I always think the name is "Algorithm Analysis". Then I remember that we're a wordy department.
