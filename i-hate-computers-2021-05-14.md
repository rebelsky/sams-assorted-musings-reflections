Today was not a good day.  Strike that.  This afternoon was not a
good afternoon.

What happened?

The day was going okay; things were taking a bit longer than normal,
but that happens.  I've been a bit off for the past few days.  Last
night, I managed to break both a glass and our blender.  In separate
incidents.  But that's not the point.  Today is the point.

At 2:00 p.m., I tried to watch a show on StageIt [1].  It would not
work.  That's not surprising.  Almost everyone who watches shows
on StageIt finds that they have to refresh once in a while [2].
But even refreshing didn't work.  I watched on my iPad instead.

A voice in the back of my mind kept asking, "What happens when my
HCI class starts at 3:00 p.m."  I was tempted to reboot my MacBook.
But rebooting is a risk; sometimes it reboots quickly, sometimes
it takes an hour or more [3,4].  Most frequently, it's slow.  So I
crossed my fingers.

Bad idea.

Really bad idea [5].

Not only did the speakers not work when I started class, the
microphone didn't either.  That's not a good way to start a class.
But it's technology.  Everyone expects it to fail.  It's just that
today's class had a relatively tight schedule: Students were running
focus groups with prototypes and I'd carefully arranged the interview
times.  I quickly switched to my iPad.  Unfortunately, (a) the class
eBoard is on my MacBook and not on my iPad and (b) Teams has a
different UI on the iPad.  I hate computers.

But I got the class started.  And my students started their focus
groups.  But I found Teams on the iPad way too frustrating.  I work
at about half the speed in navigating between chats and channels
and classes on Teams for iPad.  So I decided to reboot my MacBook.

Bad idea.

Moderately bad idea.

We got through both sets of focus groups.  My MacBook still hadn't
rebooted.  That meant I had no access to my random calling code [7].
I had no access to my notes for class.  I had no access to the papers
we were discussing.

Have I mentioned that I hate computers?

Nonetheless, we were able to debrief on the focus groups, if not to
discuss the readings for the day.  That's okay, we didn't have a
lot of time; focus groups took a while.  And I was able to talk to
them [8] about security and privacy issues I saw in their prototypes.

But, boy, I wish that had gone more smoothly.  

One positive note: We agreed that "I hate computers" should be
the course slogan.

My computer finally finished rebooting right after I told my
students to "Have a great weekend."

I hate computers.

[1] For those who don't know StageIt is a streaming service for
live musical performances.  It's been a great thing for me during
the pandemic.  But I'm a bad audience member; I often work while
watching.

[2] StageIt: The show that refreshes.  Or needs refreshes.

[3] Yes, literally.

[4] I should probably try to get that fixed.  But it's hard to
do without my laptop.

[5] Grammarly says that should not use "Really". This instance seems
to be one in which the word is needed [6].

[6] But not really needed.

[7] `sort -R classlist.txt`

[8] Rant about.
