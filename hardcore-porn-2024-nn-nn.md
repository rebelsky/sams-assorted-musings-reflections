The other day, I was talking to a colleague on Microsoft Teams. When I use Teams, I often turn on auto-captioning. It helps with my hearing loss. It also helps with my distractability.

At some point in our conversation, my colleague used the word "hardcore". I don't recall the exact context, but it was the usual meaning of "seriously overcommitted". Surprisingly, the Teams transcription did not include the word "hardcore". Instead, it used eight asterisks, "\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*".

I mentioned the change, and we started talking about it. I wanted to suggest that things are contextual, and it's only when you put "porn" after "hardcore" that it should be a problem. Conveniently, the Teams Transcription used asterisks for "porn", too.

The first statement is by Rebelsky, Samuel and says Yeah, it's only when you put **** after ******** that it's a problem. The next statement is also by Rebelsky, Samuel and says Ohh, you have porn's not acceptable either."/>

That lead me to note that "porn's not acceptable either". Surprisingly, that version of "porn" did not change.

Ah, the joy of inadequate over-screening.

In addition to being amused by Teams' behavior, I find myself a bit frustrated. Don't the hard-of-hearing deserve to see words like "hardcore" and "porn", too? I wonder if Microcensorship is configurable.

I also have a new game. What four-letter and eight-letter words can you put in that sentence?

"It's only when you put _Word_ after _software_ that it's a problem."

"It's only when you put _talk_ after _sleeping_ that it's a problem."

"It's only when you put _celt_ after _Beantown_ that it's a problem."

"It's only when you put _pool_ after _interior_ that it's a problem."

Okay, good combinations are harder than I thought. I'll need to play a bit more. Maybe I'll write a program.
