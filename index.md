Here you will find short writings on a variety of topics.  Some are
responses to questions I received from students or other people.  Some are
rants about topics I'm passionate about.  Some are explanations of how
I approach the world.  Some are just my attempts to think through a topic.
If you'd like, you can read [a longer introduction](intro-musings-v0).
If you're here because someone told you that I write about CS education,
please read [this post](intro-musings-sigcse-members).
