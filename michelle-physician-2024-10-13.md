Michelle had many identities: mother, wife, daughter, physician, Catholic, friend, board member, CMO, advocate, and more. As her husband, I got to see her in many of these roles, but not all of them. We talked a lot about her role as physician, but I rarely, if ever, got to see her practice her practice.

Being a physician was clearly Michelle's calling, a central way she made a positive difference in the world. It consumed her time and attention at work and also some of her time away from work. From the evidence I have, she was generally a great physician. Her patients loved her. In the time since she passed, many have already told me that she has become the standard by which they measure all doctors. Others have said that she's the only doctor they've had who they considered "their" doctor.

What did Michelle do to achieve this status? I didn't know. I still don't completely know. But I tried to ask a few patients and colleagues as they shared sympathy and stories. This musing represents my attempt to fit together some of the pieces. It's still not a complete picture, but perhaps it's enough.

Focus.

Integrity.

Intelligence.

Old-style family doc.
