_Warning!  As is normally the case for my not-so-legendary
preregistration musings, this musing has received almost **no**
editing or rewriting.  Writing what you see already took too much
of my life._

It's that time of the semester again!  Or at least it would be that
time of the semester if we were still in semesters rather than the
life-consuming terms that we switched to for the pandemic.  That's
right, preregistration at Grinnell just finished!  Yay!  

As an advisor, I found this preregistration period particularly
hard; I'm not sure why, but about five of my advisees didn't respond
to repeated requests for meetings, which meant that I was still
working on registration issues after 5 p.m. on the last night of
registration [1].  I suppose I could have been a bit more proactive,
but, well, I'm trying to cut down on how much extra work I'm doing.

But you're not here to read about my advising.  You're here to read about
what the results of preregistration looked like this year and my take on
those results.  I'm still not sure why people find this form of musing
interesting, but they do.

If you haven't read about Grinnell's strange registration system
before, well, this isn't the place to learn about it.  You can go
look for an earlier musing about it.  The short version is that
students first "enroll" in classes with no cap [2], then we look
at who has enrolled, and then we cut students from some classes and
balance them in other multi-section classes.  The students who are
cut then have to find other classes to take, which can be hard
because most of the popular classes are closed.  It may sound harsh,
but I'm still not sure that there's a better system.  Class-year-priority
has many problems; I'm pretty sure that few of the core courses in
CS would be open to second-year students if we used that.  I like
the idea of a fancy bidding system for courses, but that probably
advantages the quantitative students in the system.

Before I go much further, I have two short notes.  First, I have
to congratulate Carolyn Herbst Lewis on what might be the most
over-enrolled course I've seen, at least by ratios.  She has 57 [3]
folks signed up for HIS-195-01, _ST: Comparative Herbalism_, with an
intended course capacity of 10.  That's nearly a 6:1 ratio.  I'm also
looking at the number at 6:20 p.m. on Friday.  There's a chance
it could get higher when registration closes at midnight [4].

Second, I must note that one of the popular characters in this
musing does not appear in the main narrative.  John Garrison,
Professor of English and expert on reformed melted silica, is
teaching at the Newbury library this fall and/or taking advantage
of his Guggenheim Fellowship.  Congratulations Professor Garrison!

I think this fall will be somewhat complex.  We have students returning
from leave.  We have students who are planning to go abroad in the fall
who have nonetheless been advised to register for fall classes at Grinnell
in case those plans fall through.  At least in CS, students have found
ways to do "interesting" [5] things with terms, such as taking a two-course
sequence in two successive terms, which let them do the whole introductory
sequence in one year.  So, while this preregistration period isn't as crazy
as, say, last semester's, it's still not back to things as normal.

Okay, where to go from there?  I think I'll start with my department.
For those who don't want to read about my department, I've added convenient
section headings to allow you to jump ahead to the next topic.

## Computer science

We have 43 returning students pre-enrolled in CSC-151 and 72 slots
total.  We need more than 29 slots for incoming first-years, so
we'll be cutting some of those students.  I think we planned to
permit up to 24 returning students.  Apologies to those who will
be cut!  Why don't we follow the lead of, say, Linguistics and GWSS
and just prevent third-year students and seniors from preregistering?
Because there are some times in which such students can stay.  We'll
see what happens.

CSC-161, _Imperative Problem Solving_, has three slots open out of
the 48 total.  That's not bad.  I'm surprised to see the morning
session (8:30 a.m. to 9:50 a.m.) is more popular than the afternoon
session (1:00 p.m. to 2:20 p.m.)  We'll probably balance the two
sections.

CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and
Algorithms_ [6] has 22/24 slots filled in one section and 25/24 
in the other.  In this case, the morning section (10:00 a.m. to 
11:20 a.m.) is the one that has more slots available.  In any case,
I assume we'll be able to balance the two sections.

CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_, has one slot available [7].  That's
about typical.  I'm glad we don't have to worry about cutting
students from that section.

CSC-213, _Operating Systems and Parallel Algorithms_, has 27/24 in the
8:00 a.m. to 9:50 a.m. section and 20/24 in the 2:00 p.m. to 3:50
p.m.  section.  Once again, I'm surprised that the morning section
is more popular.  And, once again, I'm sure we'll be able to balance.
I'm not used to seeing open space in CSC-213. I wonder if some folks
neglected to pre-register.  I do see that two registered after 5 p.m.
on Friday.

CSC-281, _Learning from CS Alumni_, has only five students enrolled.
That makes me sad.  I think it's a valuable class; I wouldn't teach
it otherwise.  And multiple students told me last year that it was
among the most valuable classes they've taken at Grinnell.  Perhaps
I should have advertised it more.  I'm not sure what happens to
four-person one-credit classes.  If the Dean decides we should
cancel it, that's okay with me.  Arranging all the visits is hard.
But I do like seeing the alums.

CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_, has 33/20 students in the TuTh
section and 7/20 students in the MWF section.  I don't know whether
we'll be able to balance the two sections, but I hope we will.
However, I know that when I was working with my advisees, I had a
surprising number who could not fit the MWF class in their schedule.
I suppose whoever is dealing with our cuts, closes, and balances will
have to ask the Registrar to check that issue before dealing with
the cuts.

It is rare that I feel that I can make additional comments when two
sections are that imbalanced.  But, hey, I'm teaching the MWF
section, so anything goes.  Why do so many more students want to
take Prof. Eikmeier's section than mine?  I assume that the course
time is part of it.  But I also know who I would choose if I had
to decide between taking algorithms from the young, mathematically
inclined, creative, and engaged teacher or the old, curmudgeonly,
incredibly sarcastic, and often tangential teacher who sometimes
forgets to get grading done promptly.  That's not to say that I
don't think I'll do a great job with Algorithms, nor that students
won't appreciate it.  Rather, I know that my junior colleague is
awesome, and I can understand why students would prefer to take a
class from her.

On to CSC-324, _Software Design and Development_.  We have 27/16
students in the morning section and 20/16 in the afternoon section.
That looks like 15 students who we will have to cut.  But things
aren't quite that bad.  Only two students have enrolled in CSC-326,
and the two courses are designed to total twenty.  So we'll only
have to cut nine.  That's nine more than I'd like to cut, but there
will be other opportunities for them.

CSC-341, _Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_ [8]
has 34 students enrolled in twenty seats.  We'll have to cut a
lot of them.  And, as the numbers above suggest, there's not anywhere
else obvious for them to go.  I hope we'll be able to keep all of
the majors for whom this is the only CS course they are taking this
fall.  And I'm comforted to know that we have two sections of CSC-341
planned for the spring.

CSC-395, _ST: Human-Centered Programming_ has fourteen students enrolled
and a capacity of twenty.  I think it's a cool topic.  But I also like that
we have a separate HCI class that doesn't have a CS prerequisite.

Well, that's it for CS.  On to the next topic.  Let's see what classes
have high enrollments, by which I mean "more students enrolled than
the class capacity, at least as of Friday evening".

## Other significantly over-enrolled classes

As is always the case, Monessa Cummins' CLS/HIS-255-01, _History
of Ancient Greece_ is over-enrolled, this time by sixteen students 
[9].  And, as always, David Campbell's ENV-145-01, _Nations and
the Global Environment is over-enrolled, this time by nineteen
students [10].

You may recall that Carolyn Herbst Lewis' _Comparative Herbalism_
is incredibly overloaded.  Another Lewis, Abram Lewis [11], has
twenty-six students enrolled in GWS-395-01, _ST: Sex & Enchantment_,
with a cap of fifteen.  It's hard to teach upper-level seminars
with more than fifteen students.  While it's wonderful to see so
many students enrolled in the course, I expect GWSS [12] will have
to cut.

GWS special topics courses are clearly popular.  Lesley Delmenico's
GWS-195-01, _ST: Sexwork in the City_, has twenty-nine students
enrolled and a cap of fifteen.  There are enough students enrolled
for another section.  And Robert Robinson's GWS/EDU-295-01, _Black
Queer Lives and Pedagogy_, has twenty-one students enrolled with
a cap of twelve.  I wonder how Robinson will prioritize between
GWS and Education students [14].

I don't have any other particular courses to look at at the moment,
so I'll move on to the alphabetical list.

There are fifty students pre-enrolled in ANT-210-01, _Illness,
Healing and Culture_.  The course has a capacity of 20.  That's a
lot of students to drop.  And since it's a low-200 anthropology
course, I expect that a lot of those students are second-years.  I
wonder how they decide who to keep.  Perhaps it's random.  There
also don't seem to be thirty open spaces in the other 200-level
anthro courses, but there are close to that many.  I wonder if the
dropped will switch to other courses in anthropology, or whether
it's a particular interest in the topic.

As is always the case, most sections of ART-111 are over-enrolled.
There is one exception, 8:00 to 10:50 a.m. MW is not a popular time.
I'm not surprised.  Mornings on MWF are a popular time for other
classes.  The other three sections are over-enrolled by twenty-seven
students.  I think that's a bit less than normal, but I also think
that we usually offer fewer than four sections.  Still, there are
enough enrollments to add an extra section, and maybe two, if the
College would pay someone to teach one.  And it seems like we should
have some slots available for incoming first-years.  Maybe our new 
president will understand the need for more Studio faculty.

The 200-level Studio courses are all over-enrolled, with 26/15 in
Print Media, 16/15 in Painting (at that awful 8:00-10:50 a.m. MW
time), 19/15 in Sculpture, and 26/15 in Fundamentals of Video
Production.  I'm guessing that the prospective studio majors get
priority.  I feel bad for my advisees who are hoping to be in Print
Media.

I wasn't planning to mention courses that were only over-enrolled
by a few students, but I see that ART-315-01, _Adv Studio: Contemporary
Practices_ has fifteen students in a twelve-person-capacity course.
I wonder what they do about that.  I'm pretty sure that the majority
of people in that course are Studio Art majors and the others are
close enough that it's worth keeping them there.

BIO-251, _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms_, has almost the right number
of seats, just the wrong distribution.  Section one is over-enrolled
by twenty-seven students.  Sections two and three each have room for
thirteen, and section four has room for six.  But it can be hard to 
schedule the right section, given that there's time for both class and
lab.  Let's hope that the sections can be balanced.

As is often the case, most of the 300-level Biology classes are all
over-enrolled.  19/12 in BIO-343-01, _Comparative Vertebrate
Morphology_, 28/12 in BIO-365-01, _Microbiology_, 18/12 in BIO-368-01,
_Ecology, and 24/18 in BIO-380-01, _Molecular Biology_.  It looks
like there's a bit of room in BIO-395-01, _ST: Entomology_.  Who
doesn't want to study bugs?  In any case, I wonder what Bio is going
to do.  Presumably, most of the students in 300-level courses are
there because they need the course for the major.  They seem to
manage to figure it out each year, but it feels like they shouldn't
have to.

CHM-221, _Organic Chemistry I_, BIO-251's favorite partner, has a
similar strange distribution of students.  Section 4 is over-enrolled
by thirty-nine students  But there are thirteen open slots in
section 1, eleven in section 2, and eleven in section 3.  That
should cover almost all the over-enrolled students.  I hope they
can balance the sections!

The next over-enrolled course in Chemistry CHM-363, _Physical
Chemistry I_, may be more problematic.  It's over-enrolled by
twenty-one students.  I wonder if Chem can add another section.
I don't suppose the Dean can come back and teach it.

EDU-101-01, _Educational Principles in a Pluralistic Society_,
is over-enrolled by eleven students.  Fortunately, there are 
ten slots available in section 2.  I assume that will be balanced.

HIS-266-01, _History of the Modern Middle East_, has thirty-five
students enrolled and a cap of twenty-five.  It's listed as "Staff"
[17].  I wonder who that will be.

Ed Cohn's HIS-284-01, _Surveillance Modern History_, has forty-five
students pre-enrolled and a cap of 25.  I find myself wondering
about the title.  I assumed there's a longer one, such as "Surveillance
*in* Modern History" or "Surveillance* a* Modern History".  But
there doesn't seem to be.  Anyway, as technology grows the surveillance
state, I'm sure that this is a topic of great interest to our
students.  I doubt that they'll have Ed teach a second section.

MAT-316-01, _Foundations of Analysis_, is over-enrolled by twelve
students.  I assume those are all likely math majors.  There's
does not seem to be room for them in the other core 300-level class,
MAT-321-01 _Foundations of Abstract Algebra_.  I wonder what
Mathematics and Statistics will do with those students.  Does
something get cut to permit another section?  If so, what?

As often seems to be the case, Peter Hanson's Political Science
courses seem to be enrolled, almost certainly because of the
fascinating political situations we've seen in the U.S. in the past
few years.  POL-216-01, _Politics of Congress_, is over-enrolled
by only five students, but POL-219-01, _Constitutional Law &
Politics_, is over-enrolled by fourteen.  Since the Political Science
major requires at least one 200-level course in American Politics,
I wonder how they choose which students to keep.

Only one Psychology class seems to be significantly over-enrolled,
PSY-246-01, _Brain and Behavior_, with 38/25 slots occupied.  I
assume some of those students can be shifted to other sections.

SOC-240, _Social Movements_ is over-enrolled by 10, with 32/22
slots occupied.

## Courses to take

As always, I see many courses that I'd love to be able to take.
Shakespeare is always on my list.  And before it became John
Garrison's course, I kept saying I wanted to take it from Erik
Simpson.  It'd nice to see that Erik is teaching it this  year.  

I miss taking film classes, and I know that the discipline of Film
Studies has changed significantly since I took all those classes
with Gerald Mast in the mid-1980s.  So Mina Nikolopoulou's GWS-295,
_Film Genres_, would be great to be able to take [16].

As long as I'm thinking about GWS-prefix courses, I must admit that
although I have a lot of informal experience thinking about those
issues, I am not informed enough on the core literature of GWSS,
so GWS-111, _Introduction to Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies_,
would be good for me to take.

I know that making art brings me joy and challenges me to think in
new and different ways, so it would be fun to take another Studio
Art class.  But perhaps a different kind of creative activity would be 
better for me.  And music lessons are free [18].  But what to take?
I wonder if could take Jazz Bass.  Harpsichord would also be nice.
Or maybe a return to Cello, which I haven't played for 40+ years.
Or I could take the new MUS-100-01, _Introduction to Music Studies_,
which would permit me to better understand my children's conversations.
LIN-114-01, _Introduction to General Linguistics_, would also help me
better understand my children [19].  Maybe I should consider that.
But LIN-114 is only open to first-years and second-years, so I'm
probably not eligible.

Carolyn Herbst Lewis's HIS-100-02, _Feminist Killjoys of US History_
has such a great title.  

Jin Feng is teaching EAS-195-01, _EAS Gateway: Food of East Asia_.
She's written [a book on the
topic](https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295745992/tasting-paradise-on-earth/)
and gave a great Scholars' Convo on the topic.  It would be fun to
take the course.  But Jin is going to be our Associate Dean next
year, what is she doing teaching *any* class?

Karla Erickson is teaching SOC-360-01, _Work in the "New" Economy_.
Work is core to Karla's research, and I learn something new every
time I talk to Karla, so I'd love to take that class.  I wonder if
I could get her to waive the prerequisites.

John Whittaker is teaching ANT-195-01, _ST: Prehistoric Technologies_.
I've loved having John visit my TEC-154 when I've taught it.  I know
that I'm running out of time to sit in one of his classes.  This
two-credit class would be high on my list.

I'm a computer scientist because I love CS.  So it would be fund
to take a new CS course.  Peter-Michael Osera's CSC-395-01, _ST:
Human-centered Programming_, sounds like a lot of fun.  It covers
two things I love, programming languages and HCI, and I know PM
takes interesting perspectives on topics.

I mentioned that I always learn things from Karla.  I've also learned so
much from Katya Gibel Mevorach over the years.  I need to fit
in "Professor Katya's" AMS/ANT-235, _Anthropology of American Culture_.

That reminds me of the so many faculty who fit into the lists of
"people my students say great things about" and "people I respect
greatly".  I want to take classes from some of my older colleagues
[19].  I want to take classes from some of those new young exciting
folks who have joined Grinnell in recent years.  And yes, I want
to take courses from the many awesome people who fall in between
those two groups.  I think Karla calls them "mid-career faculty" [20].

I mustn't forget a wellness class.  Unfortunately, while Tennis is
among my favorite sports to play, my joints probably can't handle it
anymore.  Maybe PHE-100-22, _Swimming Technique_, PHE-100-24,
_Beginning Swimming_, or PHE-100-28, _Water Aerobics_.  I wonder
what the difference between the two swimming classes is [21].

Unfortunately, I shouldn't be adding things to my plate in my
post-heart-attack year.  And, well, I teach from 8:30--10:00 a.m.
MWF, observe peers from 10:00--11:20, and teach again from 2:30--3:50
p.m.; there isn't much free time in my schedule.  So I must admit
these are fantasies rather than realities.  But I always have SFS
and retirement to look forward to for taking courses, right?

## Assorted other comments

I see that Studio Art has gone back to two three-hour classes per
week.  That means that in semesters in which people are teaching
three courses, they are in class for eighteen hours per week.  That
doesn't leave much time for anything else, particularly since preparing
art labs is consumes a lot of time.  I extend my sympathy to my
colleagues in Studio Art.  Maybe our new president will acknowledge
the workload.

It's nice to see that MAT-218, _Elementary Number Theory_, is not
over-enrolled.  That's been an issue in past terms.  Is it a sign
that we'll have fewer Mathematics majors?  Fewer CS majors?  Is it
a side effect of this year's strange Terms and the smaller-than-normal
first-year class.  I'm not sure.

I'm surprised to see a decent amount of space available in our
statistics courses.  There are twenty-eight slots available
between the four sections of STA-209, _Applied Statistics_, and
eighteen between the two sections of STA-230, _Introduction to
Data Science_.  Is that something similar to what I have suggested
with MAT-218?  I'm not sure.  It feels a bit to me like numbers
are down across the board.

I wish more students were enrolled in Belinda Backous' ASC-101,
_Scholar's Seminar_ [22].  It's an awesomely helpful class, at least
as I hear from my students.  And Belinda is awesome.  Encourage your
students, particularly your early-career students, to take it!

I'm intrigued by course sizes.  Why are some 200-level seminars capped
at twelve while 300-level seminars get capped at fifteen, even in the
same department.  Why do some people choose an odd number (e.g., 25)
and others choose an even number (e.g. 24)?  What about those
somewhat odd even numbers, like 22 [23]?  I know that we look for
even numbers of students in CS courses because it makes it easier to 
set up pairs.  When I teach Tutorial, I hope for exactly twelve because
it allows me to break up students in so many different ways: six groups
of two, four groups of three, three groups of four, two groups of six [24].

I feel like I'm getting old.  There are so many names on the list I
don't recognize, even in the sciences.  I suppose that's because we
have been remote.  Chatting in the hallway, at the Science Teaching
and Learning Group, and elsewhere, is where we meet each other.

That's about all I have for right now.  If I had more energy, I'd
look to see what the numbers looked like in comparing this year
to last year.  But I don't have that much energy or enthusiasm.  So,
take what you will from all of these random comments.  And maybe
spend a few minutes with the schedule yourself.  You can find it
online at <https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/> [25].

Oh, that does bring up a question.  How will I get the full list of
available classes when ITS gets rid of itwebapps.grinnell.edu?  I guess
that's a question for another day.  My therapist says that I shouldn't
spend too much time worrying about the future.

[1] I wrote that at about 6 p.m. on Friday.  One of my advisees did
not express preferences until about 10 p.m.  And yes, I managed to
get them registered.

[2] Well, the system does seem to cap at 100.

[3] Heinz!

[4] The class was at 60 at the close of prereg.

[5] The scare quotes and the mediocre choice of words are intentional.

[6] We like long course names.

[7] At 5:00 p.m. on Friday, it had three slots left.  I'm amazed at
how many students register at the last possible minute.

[8] Aka "Theory".

[9] 41/25.

[10] 59/40.

[11] No relation, at least not as far as I know.

[12] You may wonder why it's sometimes "GWS" and sometimes "GWSS".
The major is "Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies", which is GWSS.
But it drops to just "GWS" for the three-letter course abbreviations [15].

[14] Given that there's no Education major, I'm not even sure how they
decide who is a member of the department.

[15] Surprisingly, the bookstore uses different four-letter abbrevs.

[16] I'm also glad to see that Mina is returning to Grinnell for another
year.

[17] Or, as one of my advisees said, "Professor Staff".

[18] Well, they are free if we're pretending that I'm a student.

[19] The number of older colleagues seems to be decreasing.

[20] I'm working on "late-career dead wood".

[21] Yes, I know, I could look it up.  But I'm not sure where.  The
PHE-100 courses have a common description in [the College
Catalog](https://catalog.grinnell.edu).  The PHE-100 courses have
a common description in the soon-to-be-retired ["Search Schedule
of
Courses"](https://webadv-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/WAPROD/WAPROD?type=P&pid=ST-X3WSEI).
The PHE-100 courses have a common description on [the Self-Service
list of
courses](https://colss-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/Student/Student/Courses).
Why can't the details be easier to find.  In any case, I'm pretty sure
that Swimming Technique is the more advanced course, which makes me sad
because it's the PE course I could most likely fit into my real schedule.

[22] Shouldn't that be "Scholars' Seminar"?

[23] In this case, by "odd", I mean "Uncommon".  As far as I can tell,
only Philosophy and Sociology use a cap of 22 for four-credit classes.

[24] Also twelve groups of one and one group of twelve, but, well, I'm not
sure we want to call those groups.

[25] Access to that page is limited to those with Grinnell accounts.
