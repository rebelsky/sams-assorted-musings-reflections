_Warning!  As is normally the case for my not-so-legendary
preregistration musings, this musing has received almost **no**
editing or rewriting.  Writing what you see already took too much
of my life._

It's that time of the semester again!  Or at least it would be that
time of the semester if we were still in semesters rather than the
life-consuming terms that we switched to for the pandemic.  That's
right, preregistration at Grinnell just finished!  Yay!  

As an advisor, I found this preregistration period particularly
hard; I'm not sure why, but about five of my advisees didn't respond
to repeated requests for meetings, which meant that I was still
working on registration issues after 5pm on the last night of
registration.  I suppose I could have been a bit more proactive,
but, well, I'm trying to cut down on how much extra work I'm doing.

But you're not here to read about my advising.  You're here to read about
what the results of preregistration looked like this year and my take on
those results.  I'm still not sure why people find this form of musing
interesting, but they do.

If you haven't read about Grinnell's strange registration system before, well,
too bad.  You can go look for an earlier musing about it.  The short version
is that students first "enroll" in classes with no cap [1], then we look at who
has enrolled, and then we cut students from some classes and balance them in
other multi-section classes.  The students who are cut then have to find other
classes to take, which can be hard because most of the popular classes are
closed.  It may sound harsh, but I'm still not sure that there's a better system.
Class-year-priority has many problems; I'm pretty sure that few of the core
courses in CS would be open to second-year students if we used that.  I like the
idea of a fancy bidding system for courses, but that probably advantages the
quantitative students in the system.

Before I go much further, I have two short notes.  First, I have
to congratulate Carolyn Herbst Lewis on what might be the most
over-enrolled course I've seen, at least by ratios.  She has 57 [2]
folks signed oup for HIS-195-01, _ST: Comparative Herbalism_, with an
intended course capacity of 10.  That's nearly a 6:1 ratio.  I'm also
looking at the number at 6:20 p.m. on Friday night.  There's a chance
it could get higher when registration closes at midnight.

Second, I must note that one of the popular characters in this musing does
not appear in the main narrative.  John Garrison, Professor of English and
expert on reformed melted silica, is teaching at the Newbury library
this fall and/or taking advantage of his Guggenheim Fellowship.
Congratulations Professor Garrison!

I think this fall will be somewhat complex.  We have students returning
from leave.  We have students who are planning to go abroad in the fall
who have nonetheless been advised to register for fall classes at Grinnell
in case those plans fall through.  At least in CS, students have found
ways to do "interesting" [3] things with terms, such as taking a two-course
sequence in two successive terms, which let them do the whole introductory
sequence in one year.  So, while this preregistration period isn't as crazy
as, say, last semester's, it's still not back to things as normal.

Okay, where to go from there?  I think I'll start with my department.
For those who don't want to read about my department, I've added convenient
section headings to allow you to jump ahead to the next topic.

## Computer science

We have 42 returning students pre-enrolled in CSC-151 and 72 slots
total.  We need more than thirty slots for incoming first-years, so 
we'll be cutting some of those students.  Sorry students!  Why don't
we follow the lead of, say, Linguistics and GWSS and just prevent
third-year students and seniors from preregistering?  Because there are
some times in which such students can stay.  We'll see what happens.

CSC-161, _Imperative Problem Solving_, has four slots open out of
the 48 total.  That's not bad.  I'm surprised to see the morning
session (8:30 a.m. to 9:50 a.m.) is more popular than the afternoon
session (1:00 p.m. to 2:20 p.m.)

CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and
Algorithms_ [4] has 21/24 slots filled in one section and 25/24 
in the other.  In this case, the morning section (10:00 a.m. to 
11:20 a.m.) is the one that has more slots available.  In any case,
I assume we'll be able to balance the two sections.

CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_, has three slots available.  That's
about typical.  I'm glad we don't have to worry about cutting
students from that section.

CSC-213, _Operating Systems and Parallel Algorithms_, has 26/24 in the
8:00 a.m. to 9:50 a.m. section and 19/24 in the 2:00 p.m. to 3:50
p.m.  section.  Once again, I'm surprised that the morning section
is more popular.  And, once again, I'm sure we'll be able to balance.
I'm not used to seeing open space in CSC-213. I wonder if some folks
neglected to pre-register.

CSC-281, _Learning from CS Alumni_, has only four students enrolled.
That makes me sad.  I think it's a valuable class; I wouldn't teach
it otherwise.  And multiple students told me last year that it was
among the most valuable classes they've taken at Grinnell.  Perhaps
I should have advertised it more.  I'm not sure what happens to
four-person one-credit classes.  If the Dean decides we should
cancel it, that's okay with me.  Arranging all the visits is hard.
But I do like seeing the alums.

CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_, has 33/20 students in the TuTh
section and 7/20 students in the MWF section.  I don't know whether
we'll be able to balance the two sections, but I hope we will.
However, I know that when I was working with my advisees, I had a
surprising number who could not fit the MWF class in their schedule.
I suppose whoever is dealing with our cuts, closes, and balances will
have to ask the Registrar to check that issue before dealing with
the cuts.

It is rare that I feel that I can make additional comments when two
sections are that imbalanced.  But, hey, I'm teaching the MWF
section, so anything goes.  Why do so many more students want to
take Prof. Eikmeier's section than mine?  I assume that the time
is part of it.  But I also know who I would choose if I had to
decide between taking algorithms from the young, mathematically
inclined, creative and engaged teacher and the old, curmudgeonly,
incredibly sarcastic, often tangential teacher.  That's not to say
that I don't think I'll do a great job with Algorithms, and that
students won't appreciate it.  Rather, I know that my junior colleague
is awesome, and I can understand why students would prefer to take
a class from her.

On to CSC-324, _Software Design and Development_.  We have 27/16
students in the morning section and 20/16 in the afternoon section.
That looks like 15 students who we will have to cut.  But things
aren't quite that bad.  Only two students have enrolled in CSC-326,
and the two courses are designed to total twenty.  So we'll only
have to cut nine.  That's nine more than I'd like to cut, but there
will be other opportunities for them.

CSC-341, _Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_ [5]
has 34 students enrolled in twenty seats.  We'll have to cut a
lot of them.  And, as the numbers above suggest, there's not really
anywhere else for them to go.  I hope we'll be able to keep all of
the majors for whom this is the only CS course they are taking this
fall.  And I'm comforted to know that we have two sections of CSC-341
planned for the spring.

CSC-395, _ST: Human-Centered Programming_ has thirteen students enrolled
and a capacity of twenty.  I think it's a cool topic.  But I also like that
we have a separate HCI class that doesn't have a CS prerequisite.

Well, that's it for CS.  On to the next topic.  Let's see what classes
have high enrollments, by which I mean "more students enrolled than
the class capacity, at least as of Friday evening".

## Other over-enrolled classes

You may recall that Carolyn Herbst Lewis' _Comparative Herbalism_
is incredibly overloaded.  Another Lewis, Abram Lewis [6]

As is always the case, Monessa Cummins' CLS/HIS-255-01, _History
of Ancient Greece_ is over-enrolled, this time by sixteen students 
[7].

There are fifty students pre-enrolled in ANT-210-01, _Illness,
Healing and Culture_.  The course has a capacity of 20.  That's a
lot of students to drop.  And since it's a low-200 anthropology
course, I expect that a lot of those students are second-years.  I
wonder how they decide who to keep.  Perhaps it's random.  There
also don't seem to be thirty open spaces in the other 200-level
anthro courses, but there are close to that many.  I wonder if the
dropped will switch to other courses in anthropology, or whether
it's a particular interest in the topic.

As is always the case, most sections of ART-111 are over-enrolled.  There
is one exception, 8:00 to 10:50 a.m. MW is not a popular time.  I'm not
surprised.  Mornings on MWF are a popular time for other classes.  The
other three sections are over-enrolled by twenty-two students.  I think
that's a bit less than normal, but I also think that we usually offer fewer
than four sections.  Still, there are enough enrollments to add an extra
section if the College would pay someone to teach one.

The 200-level Studio courses are all over-enrolled, with 26/15 in
Print Media, 16/15 in Painting (at that awful 8:00-10:50 a.m. MW
time), 19/15 in Sculpture, and 24/15 in Fundamentals of Video
Production.  I'm guessing that the prospective studio majors get
priority.  I feel bad for my advisees who are hoping to be in Print
Media.

I see that ART-315-01, _Adv Studio: Contemporary Practices_ has fifteen
sutdents in a twelve-person-capacity course.  I wonder what they do about
that.  I'm pretty sure that the majority of people in that course are
Studio Art majors and the others are close enough that it's worth keeping
them there.

BIO-251, _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms_, has almost the right number
of seats, just the wrong distribution.  Section one is over-enrolled
by twenty-seven students.  Sections two and three each have room for
thirteen, and section four has room for six.  Let's hope that can be
balanced.

As is often the case, most of the 300-level Biology classes are all
over-enrolled.  19/12 in BIO-243-01, _Comparative Vertebrate
Morphology_, 28/12 in BIO-365-01, _Microbiology_, 18/12 in BIO-368-01,
_Ecology, and 24/18 in BIO-380-01, _Molecular Biology_.  It looks
like there's a bit of room in BIO-395-01, _ST: Entomology_.  Who
doesn't want to study bugs?  In any case, I wonder what Bio is going
to do.  Presumably, most of the students in 300-level courses are
there because they need the course for the major.  They seem to
manage to figure it out each year, but it feels like they shouldn't
have to.

CHM-221, _Organic Chemistry I_, BIO-251's favorite partner, has a
similar strange distribution of students.  Section 4 is over-enrolled
by thirty-eight students  But there are thirteen open slots in
section 1, eleven in section 2, and eleven in section 3.  That
should cover almost all the over-enrolled students.  I hope they
can balance the sections!

The next over-enrolled course in Chemistry CHM-363, _Physical
Chemistry I_, may be more problematic.  It's over-enrolled by
twenty-one students.  I wonder if Chem can add another section.
I don't suppose the Dean can come back and teach it.

## Assorted other comments

I see that Studio Art has gone back to two three-hour classes per
week.  That means that in semesters in which people are teaching
three courses, they are in class for eighteen hours per week.  That
doesn't leave much time for anything else, particularly since preparing
art labs is time consuming.  I extend sympathy to my colleagues in
Studio Art.

I wish more students were enrolled in Belinda Backous' ASC-101, _Scholar's
Seminar_ [8].  It's an awesomely helpful class, at least as I hear from
my students.  And Belinda is awesome.

[1] Well, the system does seem to cap at 100.

[2] Heinz!

[3] The scare quotes and the mediocre choice of words are intentional.

[4] We like long course names.

[5] Aka "Theory".

[6] No relation, at least not as far as I know.

[7] 41/25.

[8] Shouldn't that be "Scholars' Seminar"?
