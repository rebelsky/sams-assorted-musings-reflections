You know about cover bands, right?  These are bands whose primary
purpose is to play music like the original artists.  Some play a
variety of covers.  Others focus on single artists.  There are
Beatles cover bands, Eagles cover bands, Elvis impersonators, Journey
cover bands, Dolly impersonators, and more.  In the old days, cover
bands often just played the music.  These days, some try to approximate
a real show, wearing the clothes and mimicing the actions of the
original band.  Think "Beatlemania", although perhaps not quite so excessive.

There are also what I might call "nearly cover bands".  I seem to
recall that at one time, there were three sets of Beach Boys
simultaneously touring the US.  I think each had at least one person
who had been in the Beach Boys, but at least one had someone who
had only been in a later incarnation of the Beach Boys.

That brings us to what I did last night.  Michelle and I went with
some friends to see the latest incarnation of the _Happy
Together_ tour.  The current bands on that tour are The Turtles
featuring Flo and Eddie, Gary Puckett (but not the Union Gap), The
Association, The Buckinghams, The Vogues, and the Cowsills.

I had assumed that I'd see some cover bands in the show.  After
all, these are all bands from the 1960s.  And I was right.  The
Vogues had no original members, although I think two of them had
sung with one of the original members in one of the two versions
of the post-60s Vogues [1].  The Association had exactly one original
member, Jules Gary Anderson, although he'd been in the group off
and on throughout the years [2].

The show also included genuine original artists.  The Cowsills had
three members of the Cowsill family on the stage [3].  Gary Puckett
was, in fact, Gary Puckett, still in incredibly good voice at age
80.  While there were only two Buckinghams on stage, both seemed to
be original members from the West Side of Chicago.

And then we have "The Turtles, featuring Flo and Eddie".  I assumed
that Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan would be performing.  However,
Howard Kaylan is not on the tour this year.  And, unfortunately,
Mark Volman seems to have been exposed to Covid-19.  So "The Turtles,
featuring Flo and Eddie" was Ron Dante [4], Godfrey Townsend, and
the backing band.  No Flo.  No Eddie.  I wasn't really expecting a
Turtles cover band.  But they were a pretty damn good cover band.
And, unsurprisingly, Susan Cowsill was wonderful on the cowbell.

In spite of the substitutions, I enjoyed the show.  A lot.  The
not-Vogues had great harmonies; I really love "Five O'Clock World"
and their version of "You're The One".  Most of the performers were
either having fun on stage or were good at faking it [5].  I was
particularly fond of the Cowsill's performance.  The audience clearly
loved the show.  I would have preferred a bit more up-tempo music
(e.g., if we'd had Mark Lindsey from Paul Revere and the Raiders,
as originally scheduled, or perhaps even Chuck Negron of Three Dog
Night).  Still, as long as I embrace it for what it was, I'm satisfied.

**_Postscript_**: In case you've forgotten from [an earlier
musing](the-association), Michelle and I consider "Cherish" and
"Happy Together" incredibly creepy songs.  I look forward to a show
in which the performers embrace that creepiness.

**_Postscript_**: I also look forward to hearing a mashup of "Young Girl" and "Don't
Stand So Close to Me".

[5] Susan Cowsill seemed to be having fun offstage, too.  I saw her
dancing along at times.
