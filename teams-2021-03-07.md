I've adopted Microsoft Teams for my remote classes this year.  Why?
Because it seemed the best of the primary three options I have:
Teams, Blackboard Collaborate, and Webex.  I refuse to use Blackboard
Collaborate because it does not provide sensible features, like
blurring the background [1] or seeing more than a few students at
once.  Webex is better than BBC [2] in that it supports both of
those features, but it did not provide breakout groups when I started
using it and, the last I checked, it did not do a particularly good
job with breakout groups.  Also, Grinnell does not give students
their own Webex accounts, so if I select Webex for class, students
will need a different platform for outside-of-class meetings.

Teams shows me much of my class at once, not as much as Webex, but
more than BBC.  Teams lets students blur their backgrounds, or
replace them, or whatever.  Teams didn't have breakout groups when
I started using it, but it's easy enough for students to create
their own video or audio chats that it seemed reasonable to post a
list of partners and have students create their own groups.  I still
find that better than using the official Breakout Group features.

I also appreciate that we can seemlessly switch between classes,
student-hosted video conferences, text chat, and such.  I can point
students to another team or another channel on another team, such as 
the evening tutor sessions channel on the CS Team.

But Teams also frustrates me endlessly.  How?  Here are some of the
ways.

_Teams does not let you download a channel or a chat_.  In a world of
data preservation, don't you think that your users would want ways to
preserve some of their work?  I'd think so.  It's a commonly requested
feature.  But no, Microsoft does not see fit to allow you to do so.

_Teams does not permit threaded discussions in chats, only in channels._
Threaded discussions are a wonderful tool to help keep all of the 
posts about a particular topic together.  Why not provide the same
feature set of chat?  Some of my chat is open-ended, but some alternates
between individual issues.  If the technology for threading is there,
why not take advantage of it?

_Teams does not provide traditional "Save" options for attachments._
Every other program I use lets me choose a directory for files I
download and lets me rename it if necessary.  (My Web browsers require
a bit of configuration to do so, but they still permit it.)  But
Teams?  Teams assumes that you want to save the file with the same
name in your Downloads folder, or at least Teams for macOS does.
I want control.  I don't want the extra overhead of having to open
my downloads folder and renaming the file.

_Teams only pretends to use Markdown._  I can use backticks for
code/monospace.  I can use single underscores for italics.  But
I can't use single asterisks for italics, nor can I use double underscores
for boldface.  Basic Markdown is effectively a standard.  Why can't Microsoft
follow standards? [3]

_Teams does not store formatted text in its originally source format._
If I write something in Markdown, I'd like you to preserve it in Markdown.
But all the evidence I've seen is that, behind the scenes, Teams has
translated the formatted text permanently.

Why does Microsoft do all of this (or fail to do so much of this)?  I
have no idea.  I'm going to fall back on my normal conclusion: Microsoft
designers have no clue about how other products work and no desire to
learn, and Microsoft users get so used to Microsoft design that they
cannot envision anything else.

[1] I firmly believe we should boycott any educational videoconferencing
system that does not give students the option of hiding their working
environment.

[2] No, not *The* BBC; just Blackboard Collaborate.

[3] Oh.  Nevermind.  Microsoft never follows standards that it doesn't
write itself.  It made variants of HTML and Javascript and more.
