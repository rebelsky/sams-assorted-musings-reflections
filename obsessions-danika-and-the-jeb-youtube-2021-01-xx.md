As I was writing about [my obsessive response to the Danika and the
Jeb Daylist](obsessions-danika-and-the-jeb-daylist-2021-01-xx), I
found myself linking to the various videos in the Daylist and
elsewhere.  My muse then suggested to me that I also make a list
of all the videos on YouTube and elsewhere.  She clearly buys in
to my obsessions about as much as I do.  So, here goes: a list,
with (relatively short) commentary.  I've tried to mark the ones
posted by D&tJ with an asterisk.

Followup: Someway far to far into this musing, I decided to set up
[a separate database](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/datj/youtube)
[1].  You'll find that the hobgoblin of my small mind attacked me
me much less than normal.  That is, I've left things many things
non-uniform, and perhaps even incomplete.

Originals
---------

These are songs written by Danika (and others). 
I've placed them in alphabetical order and added some short comments.

> > "I jumped in my car and I drove way" "Gone are the days I could turn
    your head and make you look my way."  Time for a change?

"**Black Swan**"

> _A wonderful love song.  Musically, I like the contrast between
  the verses and the chorus.  And the chorus is definitely one of
  those "Soulful Danika" segments that I love.  Did they write this
  under conract to someone?  I think so._

> [Patreon Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QjaSBU757Q) (Daylist N)

> > Jeb on his custom Stonebridge.

> > It's definitely the version I know best.  I like the camera
    work.  It's nice to see D&tJ from different angles.  It looks
    like the video is by [Chaz Mazzota](https://chazmazzota.com).

> Part of [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville - Nov. 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8) (6:50--10:50)

> > Jeb on black Fender electric.  Danika on just vocals.

"**Bluebird**"

> As far as I can tell, the most-posted D&tJ song on YouTube, with at
  least nine versions.  (It also appears on some of the promo videos.)

> [Live at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhgtd5PHUtA) (Official, Daylist 21)

> [Studio version from _Living Your Dream_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlotUQmAEuI)

> > CD Baby seems to have put a lot of studio versions online.

> [Studio vesion from _Balance Volume 1_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6dvv3bR_dc)

> >

> [Promo video shot a Cedar Ridge Vineyards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stQAVua1eS4)

> > I like the part with them playing guitars while working through
    the vineyard.  The promo parts for Cedar Ridge are a little cheesy
    (ooh, let's watch them walk through the Vineyard with glasses of
    wine).  But it does remind me that I want to visit at some point
    after the pandemic is over.

> [Live at the Camphouse, Chattanooga, TN, 2013-05-24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L81fhhThd58)

> > Jeb and Danika on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electrics.

> [Live at Eddie Owen Presents, 2015-06-12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_OgTlg_8KM)

> > Jeb and Danika on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electrics.

> [Live at Muddy Creek Music Hall, 2016-09-15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6svL54jbYZg)

> > Danika on her brown Stonebridge custom acoustic.  Jeb on his 
    cutaway Stonebridge acoustic/electric.

> [Live from the Listening Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7hgL8NV6g)

> > Danika on her brown Stonebridge custom acoustic.  Jeb on his 
    cutaway Stonebridge acoustic/electric.

"**Breathe In Let Go**"

> _The only song that explicitly appears twice on the Daylist.  (A few
  appear again in partial form on the behind-the-scenes video.)

> [Songs with Friends (w/Alyssa Jacey and Kira Hooks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoDGscvtIA0) (Official, Unlisted, Daylist 11)

> > The harmony on the chorus is really nice.  I also appreciate the 
    percussion that Jacey adds [2].

> > In case you want to check out these other artists, you can check
    them out at <https://alyssajacey.com> and <https://www.kirahooks.com>
    or on YouTube ([Alyssa Jacey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHLXs6ZLxBu_Wb8ohiSqNDw) and [Kira Hooks](...)).

> > I'd love to see more in the "Songs With Friends" series.

> [Live at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSs6NoPl6FI) (Official, unlisted)

> > Danika on grand piano.  Jeb on acoustic guitar.

> > A solid version, although I admit I like the harmony on the Songs with
    Friends version.  I'd like to hear Jeb's guitar mixed a bit louder.

> [Live on stage, somewhere, ca. 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDhmImjKR3o)

> > Danika on electric piano.  Jeb on Taylor acoustic.

> > Video shot sideways.  The videographer starts backstage and moves around
    to the front.  Someone nearby sings along.  One of the few D&tJ outside
    videos without a lot of crowd noise.  A nice version; I like the mix
    of Jeb's guitar.

"**Concrete Dragons**"

> _Comments_

> [Live from the Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc0sx2wnUIQ) (Official, Daylist 2)

> > Jeb on green strat-shaped electric.  Danika on vocals.

> > I'm not sure if there are any other versions of this song out there. 
    I wish I'd been paying closer attention at the shows.

"**Dreams Held Hostage**" (Official)

> _One that turned up during my obsessive search.  I don't think I'd
  heard it before.  Or at least it's not one I hear regularly._

> [Live at the Redstone Room, Davenport, IA 2012-03-30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6goppFpmuYI) (Official)

"**Half As Strong As You**"

> _One that turned up during my obsessive search.  I don't think I'd
  heard it before.  Or at least it's not one I hear regularly._

> [Live at the Mill, Iowa City, 2013-02-06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnh3TnAEwBQ) (Official)

"**How To Be Beautiful**"

> Back to the other reason I love Danika and the Jeb: Songs with a
  strong, encouraging, positive message.  I've mentioned that before,
  right?  Anyway, it's a song I love.  I see that she co-wrote it
  with Ann Juenger, who is responsible for the lyrics on the
  [pandemic-enhanced version of John Prine's "In Spite of
  Ourselves"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrn_eR1jyLw).

> [Official Music Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRnWfnMFtDo)

> > Jeb appears (looking young) playing an electric guitar that says
    "Novak" and his signature Taylor acoustic/eletric cutaway.  Danika
    appears on piano.  Of course, it's a music video, so it's hard to
    tell what they used.

> > What should we make of the use of fan photos in both of the
    Ann Juenger songs (this video and "In Spite of Ourselves")?

> [Album Version from _Living Your Dream_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x84ypv9S7A)

"**In A Memory**"

> _Comments_

> [Live at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEbuNtXMosI) (Official, Daylist N)

> > I like most of the videos from this show.  Danika's clearly having
    fun.

> [Live at Two Old Hippies, 2013-10-25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcefObivyBs)

> > Jeb on the Taylor cutaway acoustic/electric.  Danika on vocals.

> [Live at Antique Archeology, Nashville, TN, 2015-03-28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB8mNI3QAHA)

> > Jeb on Taylor cutaway acoustic.  Danika on vocals.

"**Infinity**"

> _I'm not sure why, but I don't haev a lot to say about this song._

> [Life at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4X-KIVBtE) (Official, Daylist 20)

"**Lucky For Me**"

> _An original Christmas/Holiday song.  I appreciate the relentlessly
  upbeat theme, with Danika using the voice of a young girl reciting
  the many things she's luck about (such as being the taster for
  cookies).  Next year, all the D&tJ holiday songs need to go on
  my holiday playlist._

> [Acoustic Christmas Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aSxue3nl6o) (Official, Daylist 30)

"**Living Your Dream**"

>  _I haven't listened to this enough to have an opinion._

> [Live at the Mill, Iowa City, 2013-02-06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s2tVMYmuBY)

> > Jeb and Danika on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electrics.

"**Lock Me In Tonight**"

> _Danika writes and performs what I think of as a standard
  modern country song (with a somewhat standard official
  music video).  As I've noted before, I wasn't thrilled with
  the song the first time I heard it (as part of the Daylist),
  but it's grown on me and, at times, has been an earworm._

> [Official Music Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=910w4ICkj8A) (Daylist 33)

> > Danika appears playing the Taylor Cutway Acoustic/Electric and a
    silver Les-Paul-shaped electric.  But it's a music video, so I'm
    not sure what she actually played.

> > I'm not sure why, but I don't really like seeing Danika presented
    as a sex object.  She's definitely a beautiful woman, but, as she
    sings in "How To Be Beautiful", it's not just outer beauty that
    matters.  Do we really need to see the bathrobe dropping to the
    ground or the nightclothes?

> > Part of the video has Danika throwing out what appears to be a
    male partner's shirts and ties.  Those actions don't really 
    match the lyrics of the song, but it's clear that the video
    authors are trying to tell some kind of story.  I'd like to
    know more about it.

"**Make My Own Day**"

> [Live at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL0PVAp1w_4) (Daylist 8)

> > The version from the Daylist.  The inroduction makes me a bit sad:
    "I taught for four years.  Working with some fantastic teachers
    completely inspired me to quit teaching."  But she's right; it's
    better to do something you are passionate about.  And I'm glad
    she makes music.

> [Live at 20 Front Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puk9gifzOBg)

> > A shorter version than I'm used to.

> [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville - Nov. 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8)

> > Comments.

"**No Hometown**"

> I *think* this is a relatively new song; written in spring 2020 and
  released to Patreons [3,4].  One of my favorite D&tJ songs; speaks well
  to what life might feel like in many of the Iowa towns around here.

> [Patreon Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ix7jlzyKjw)

> > The version from the Daylist.  Perhaps the only version---other than
    the performances on StageIt.

"**Open Up**"

> _One of my faves, although I'm not completely sure why._

> [Live at Eddie Owen Presents, 2015-06-12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WieI4W2Tt9Y)

> > Jeb and Danika on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electrics

"**Pockets Full of Gold**"

> _Comments_

> [Patreon Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTvYHGEFX8) (unlisted)

> > Reminds me that I miss the mini-art-shows.

"**Rainy Day Lovin'**"

> _Feels like it could be a mid-50's torch song._

> [Live for Video in Nashville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuL2slrnB-g) (Official, Daylist 27)

> > Danika on vocals (and with red hair!).  Jeb on the cutaway acoustic (and looking surprisingly young).

> [Live at Eddie Owen Presents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge6ymxFYILM)

> > Jeb on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electric.  Danika on vocals.

> [Live at the M-Shop in Ames, 2013-02-01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_HjC5KdSA) (Official)

> > Jeb on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electric.  Danika on vocals.

> [Live at Goose Island, Chicago, IL, 2011-08-11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=METUcFBsCeU)

> > Danika on vocals.  Jeb in the background on some guitar (probably the Taylor)

> > Too much background noise for my taste.  Danika looks really happy
    at the beginning.

"**Sway Into the Storm**"

> _I'm surprised that there isn't a hit cover of this song (probably
  by a male artist).  It has everything I expect in good modern
  country: an interesting story, a compelling vocal riff in the
  chorus, some great building musical tension, and more. 

> I also like the references to other songs---"You took the high
  road and I took the low", "No redemption song", "Shelter from 
  the storm" (more implicit), perhaps others.  There was some point
  during the binge that I listened to this four times in a row.

> [Live at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLiZfxJQWRs) (Official, Daylist 23)

> > 

> [Live at Eddie Owen Presents, 2015-06-12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4Mnr7074_Y)

> > Jeb on Taylor cutaway acoustic/electric.  Danika just on vocals.

> [Live at the Sweetwater Cafe House Concert, 2016-10-15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fov0-6Xdnb0)

> > Danika on vocals.  Jeb on his Stonebridge custom guitar.

> > Misidentified as "You Take the High Road".

"**The Trouble With the Truth**"

> I love the sound of this; I feel like I don't listen to the lyrics
  closely enough; they seem to be the kind that demand attention.

> [Live at the Knight Theatre, Charlotte, NC, 2020-02-22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIrsMny0d9U) (Daylist 16)

> > 

> 12:30--17:00 of [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville - Nov. 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8) 

> > Jeb on black Fender electric.  Danika on custom acoustic.

> > After enough time with the Daylist version, I appreciate hearing it 
    with an electric guitar.

"**Time For A Change**"

> A sad, folky, narrative song.  I really like this one.  It feels like
  it should be a classic.

> [Live from JJ Kellys, Lansing, IL, 2011-03-10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCk1dc-uIXA)

> > Jeb and the Danika on Taylor acoustic/electrics.

> > Untitled here.  It took me a bit to remember which song it is.  
    Perhaps my favorite of the versions I've heard..

> > Except that there's lots of background noise.  I hate background noise.  
    But I love this song and this performance.  I don't understand
    how musicians can perform when everyone is talking this much.

> [Album version from _Balance, Volume 1_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu_CeEd9bfQ)

> > Has a nice guitar solo (presumably by Jeb).

> > It appears that I was the first person to watch this video.  I
    wish D&tJ got credit for these views.

> [On the _Songs for Freedom_ compilation](https://abolitiontour.bandcamp.com/track/time-for-a-change)

> > Full band version!  Not the same as the one on _Balance, Volume 1_.
    I'm not sure whether it's the same as the version on _Second Chances_.
    I particularly like the backing vocals.

"**Unlit Match**"

> _One of my favorite songs.  I'll admit that it's more about the
  overall sound of the song than, say, the lyrics.  I also like
  the chorus a lot.  I find it strange that, although there are multiple
  versions online, there's no version in the Daylist._

> Part of [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville - Nov. 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8) (1:40--5:20)

> > I really like Jeb's guitar work on this one.

"**Without Love**

> [Andy and Debbie's House Concert 2018-10-21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugi8w9a_VYs)"

> > Jeb on his Stonebridge custom cutaway.  Danika on vocals.

> > The poster refers to it as "The loooove song"

"**You Make a Bad Day Good**"

> _Comments_

Covers
------

Danika and the Jeb do a variety of covers, most of which they make their
own in some way or other.

"**316**" (written by Eddie Van Halen; originally performed by Eddie Van Halen)

> [Live in the Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoDGscvtIA0)

"**Ain't No Sunshine**" (written by Bill Withers; originally performed by Bill Withers)

> Withers died near the start of the pandemic.  I remember D&tJ playing this
  as a tribute right afterwards.  It falls solidly in the "I love it when
  Danika sings soul" camp.  However, it appears they've been playing this
  for awhile.

> [Bill Withers Tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It6qZCS7bjo) (Daylist 6)

> > I love Danika's voice on this, and I love the no-backing "I
    know I know ...".  (Withers [5] used drum backing in the original
    and it looks like he did so in [live
    versions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICIOJqEb5c), too.)
    he uses just drums there.)  As always, Jeb has some great guitar
    work, too.

> [Live at the Mill, Iowa City, 2013-02-06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKF6XhhR_gI)

> > I was asking myself "Why is this 14 minutes long?"  It turns out that
    Jeb does a lot of soloing on this.

> [Live at Sugarland House Concerts, posted 2019-09-29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iui2vaP-MK8)

> > Danika on her brown Stonebridge custom acoustic.  Jeb on his 
    cutaway Stonebridge acoustic/electric.

"**Angel From Montgomery**" (Written by John Prine, originally performed by John Prine)

> They do a wonderful job on this.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a
  live video.  Perhaps they'll post one soon.

"**Auld Lang Syne** (lyrics by Robert Burns, performed by lots of people)

> [End of 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmyXNs4xl2U) (Official, Daylist 13)

"**Baby It's Cold Outside**" (written by Frank Loesser; Danika credits the Mel Tormé version)

> Isn't this song controversial?

> [Acoustic Christmas Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INQ7Z1IrSYE) 

"**Bad Moon Rising**" (written by John Fogerty; originally performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival)

> One of CCR's many awesome songs.  I'm not sure what else to add.

> [Live from the Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXBEu9z4TE4)

> > To be honest, this is one of the D&tJ songs that I find doesn't
    add much to the original.

"**Dancing in the Snow**" (written by Barnowski/Barker/Roma; originally performed by The Skyliners) 

> _It took me awhile to track down the original of this one.  It appears 
  to be by some
  fellow Nashville songwriters and was [originally performed by the
  legendary Skyliners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBgmlPjBuTA).
  I think D&tJ's version could be a holiday classic._

> [Acoustic Christmas version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyeqz0evnlA) (Official, Daylist 1)

> > Jazzier than the Skyliners' version.  Sounds like an old classic as
    they do it, which I think makes it a new classic.

"**Danny Boy**" (written by Frederic Weatherly to the tune of "Londonderry Air"; performed by too many artists to count).

> [Birthday video ca. 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrn_eR1jyLw) (Daylist 12)

> > Danika vocals.  Jeb on Guild twelve-string.

> > I appreciate Jeb's comment at the end: "I think this is a 1976 Guild
    twelve-string."  I'm pretty sure he knows that it's a Guild and a 
    twelve-string.  The "1976" suggests that he looked up the serial
    number.  It looks a lot like my Guild.  I'd love to see him play it
    more at one of the shows (e.g., on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".)

>

> > Just Danika and her guitar.

"**Diamonds**" (written by Furler/Levin/Eriksen/Hermansen, originally performed by Rihanna)

> Rihanna?  I think I'm too old to know music by people like Rihanna.

> [First take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjfojYK9Arw) (Daylist 31)

> > Danika on Yamaha MOX8 electric piano/synthesizer.

> > I'm sure the blue outfit makes Alyssa Jacey happy.  I also find it
    odd to see Danika with bangs.

"**Forever Young**"

> _Comments._

> [Live at the Redstone Room, Davenport, IA 2012-03-30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewWoUfzA_5w) (Official)

> Danika and the Jeb on the Taylor cutaway acoustic/electrics.

> Too much crowd noise.

"**In Spite of Ourselves**" (music by John Prine; parody lyrics by Ann Juenger)

> _How can you go wrong with John Prine?  And lyrics adapted to the pandemic makes it a bit easier to get through all that's happening._

> [Patreon Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrn_eR1jyLw)

> > [Their comments](https://www.patreon.com/posts/in-spite-of-john-38206695?l=fr)

> > A part of me wishes that I'd sent in a photograph when they asked for picdtures from their Patreons.  But, well, I'm a bit private.

"**Little Wing**" (written by Jimi Hendrix; originally originally performed by Jimi Hendrix; famous cover by Stevie Ray Vaughn)

> D&tJ usually perform this as a long Jeb solo (on acoustic or electric)
  with Danika on rhythm guitar.  But why doesn't Danika sing?  The
  song has lyrics.  The long-extended-solo plus vocals works well
  on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".  I assume it would work here,
  too.  I do see from the notes that SRV made it an instrumental, so that's
  probably the version they adapt.

> [Live at ArtisTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urImTjX-rAQ) (Official, Daylist 19)

> > Part of the Live at ArtisTree series.  I enjoy Jeb's solo, but
    I'll admit that I prefer Hendrix's version.  And, as I said
    above, I miss the vocals.

> > I watched this at double speed once.  It's too fast for the music,
    but I enjoyed seeing how they move at that speed.  (I'm also
    amused that the next song, "Infinity", has a lyric of "Let's
    take it slow".)

> 31:00--37:45 of [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville - Nov. 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8) (Official)

"**No Body, No Crime**" (written by Taylor Swift; originally performed by Taylor Swift featuring HAIM)

> [Live in the Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2MF-jLXbIc)

> > I don't generally listen to Taylor Swift.  This cover suggests that
    perhaps I should.  A regular part of D&tJ's current StageIt series.
    For better or worse, this has become one of my earworms.

"**Oh Darling**" (written by Lennon/McCartney, originally performed by the Beatles)

> [Live at The Grape Life House Concert, Davenport, Iowa, 2010-10-30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak37ovzeLFk)

> > Jeb on guitar (Taylor?), Danika on vocals.

> > Danika in a page bob?  Or maybe a wig.  Probably the latter.  

> > The only version of this song I could find.  Fun.

"**Papaazzi**" (...)

> I'll admit that I don't know the original.  What's that my mother used
  to say?  Whole segments of modern American culture have  passed me by.

> [Live at Cedar Ridge Vineyard, Swisher, IA, 2011-06-xx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvryFYH71Ps)

> > Jeb and Danika on matching Taylor electric/acoustic cutaways.

"**Some Kind of Wonderful**" (written by John Ellison; originally performed by Soul Brothers Six; famous cover by Grand Funk Railroad)

> _One of my favorite D&tJ covers.  The song works incredibly well with just vocals and guitars.  As Danika suggests in the ArtisTree version, this is a song they really make their own._

> > We play mostly original music that we wrote.  Occasionally, we will throw
in a song that we wish we wrote.  But we hope you have never heard it
anything close to this before

> 23:55--28:20 of [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville, 2020-11-21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8) (official)

> > Jeb on Telecaster.  Danika on vocals.

> > Sad.  A tribute to a friend who passed away on from Covid.

> Do you really want to go head to head with Clapton and Harrison?  Jeb
  does a great job.  I'm not enough of a musician to pay attention to
  the details, but it seems he does something new and different each
  time.  And it's amazing what he can on an acoustic.

    I particularly appreciate the hammer-on work around 4:30.

Shows
-----

[**Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville - Nov. 21, 2020**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8)

> Jeb on black Fender electric guitar.  Danika on brown acoustic and
  Nord Electro4 electric piano.

> I'm not sure why they decided to post this particular show, but it's a
  way for you to have the StageIt experience, albeit without the chatter
  that makes you feel more like part of a community.

> Starts with some of the chatter (although Danika normally remembers to
  tune her guitar in advance).  Includes some conversations with the
  normal crowd (Gale, Hannah W, etc.), although I think Hannah is new
  to the crowd at this point.  There's a photographer, too.  I
  don't think I'd seen that before.  And Danika talks about the joy
  of being part of an online audience, which isn't something that
  she normally does.  She could be describing her own show: "It's
  fun to hang out before the show; it's like they are all friends."

> "**Unlit Match**" 1:40--5:20.

> "**Black Swan**" 6:50--10:50.

> "**The Trouble With The Truth**" 12:30--17:00.

> "**Make My Own Day**" 18:00--22:35.

> "**Some Kind of Wonderful**" 23:55--28:20.

> "**Little Wing**" 31:00--37:45.

Behind the Scenes
-----------------

Over the years, Danika has posted a variety of "Behind the Scenes" videos
to YouTube.

[2012 Christmas Card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgDk5K4Fx00) (Official)


[A Day in the Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIjbXVceoHg) (Official, Daylist 17)

> I enjoy the description of what happens before (and during) a show.  Is
  this part of a flower-petal tour?

[At Your Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xsBssUSIVs)

> A fifteen-minute interview "through the wonders of the Internet", right
  before the pandemic hit.  Remember when Internet-enabled interviews
  were a special thing?  They were scheduled to perform in Quincy,
  Mass on March 15.  I assume they didn't make it.  I liked hearing more
  of Jeb's background in this interview.  I also learned that Jeb plays
  saxophone.

[Behind the Scenes: Lock Me In Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjMyMmfTSWo)

> Notes to come.

> Notes to come.

[Introduction to Danika & the Jeb, Nashville Acoustic Pop Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjJK6I45qtY) (Daylist 18)

> Lots of snippets of music.  A bunch of photos.  Probably intended more for
  venues than for fans.  Ends with "..."

[Kickstarter Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFIfexAIa8s)

> Is this the video that convinced me to back her?  I can't remember.

[Lancaster UK Music Festival 'Blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGCfi3ZfBqs) (Official, Daylist 35)

> I love the opening, in which Danika points to a sign for one of her shows.

> There's also a part where she's shooting video of Jeb and he's clearly
  in a "I guess I have to put up with this" mood.

> I like the "I've been stuck ... in a memory" song snippet at the end.
  I wish I could remember which song it is.

[Music Video Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoafUap29IQ) (Official)

> I'm not quite sure what to make of this.  There's an advertisement
  for her CD Release show at the end; I think this was intended to get
  folks to go.  But it's mostly an "end of the day, in a car, off to get
  beers" video.

[Music Video Day 2 Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ9fmC2u5Xg) (Official)

[UK Music Tour 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxTzunRavHg) (Official, Daylist 34)

> Fun.  I appreciate the visit to the record store.

[Video Press Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVpD6D0uA3k)

> Some of the quotes bother me.  "Danika Holmes isn't just easy on
  the eyes.  She's a true American telent ... I couldn't stop
  listening."  Isn't that kind of offensive?  How often do folks
  say "He's not just a hunk; he plays music, too"?

**_Postscript_**: Have I now reached obsessive fan level?  I still wonder
why I ended up with this obsession.  If I had noticed that Dan Navarro
did regular concerts earlier, would that be more of an obsession?  I love
Lowen & Navarro.

---

**_Postscript_**: Somewhere through this musing, I found myself
wanting to identify the instruments precisely.  Not just "acoustic
guitar".  Not just "Jeb's cutaway acoustic" or "Danika's beat-up
dark-brown acoustic", but something more detailed.  Dare I ask them
for a list of instruments?  Jeb's electric is almost certainly a
[Fender John 5 Signature
Telecaster](http://www.fendercustomshop.com/series/artist/john-5-hb-signature-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-black/).
The cutout acoustic/electrics that both Jeb and the Danika play are
by Taylor [6].  I can't tell which of the Taylors they are.  As far
as I can tlle, Danika's brown guitar doesn't have a manufacturer
name on the headstock, and the neck says "Music is what feeling
sounds like."  I hadn't noticed that until I looked closely.  Ah,
it's a [Stonebridge](https://www.stonebridgeguitars.com).  And now
that I look more carefully, one of Jeb's cutaways is clearly a
Stonebridge and one is clearly a Taylor.  Maybe I'll need to go
back to just using the generic.  While the shapes are similar, the
Stonebridge has fancier engraving on the neck.

---

**_Postscript_**: I don't really have time for more obsessions right
now, other than perhaps a much-needed obsession with rearranging
my office and lab.  But when I do, I think I'm going to collect
D&tJ lyrics.

[1] As I noted in an earlier (now-deleted) Postscript: I'm a computer
scientist.  Why didn't I set up a database for all these data?
Perhaps because I didn't realize quite how much there would be.
It's also clear that the data I wanted to record changed over time.

[2] Is Alyssa Jacey also a percussionist?  There's [a video of her
performing drums on the Beatles' "Come
Together"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myms-aO0cpU).

[3] Is "Patreons" the right term?  Perhaps "Patreon supporters?"
I see that some folks use "Patrons" as the term.

[4] There is also [an undated live version](2020-04-27), which suggests
    that it precedes the pandemic.

[5] Should I say "Jones" since Booker T. Jones produced and arranged?

[6] I'm surprised that Taylor never designated Jeb as a "Taylor Artist"
or some such.  He's since moved on to Stonebridge, so I guess that won't
happen.
