One of the current important trends in higher education is the use of equitable grading practices. As the name suggests, such practices are designed to help ensure better equity in how students learn. There are many such practices. For example, one might give students a choice of how best to demonstrate their knowledge [1] or one might focus more on what students have learned rather than when they learn it [2].

Starting a few years ago, I've been using a form of equitable grading called "mastery grading". To be more precise, I've been using a variety of forms of mastery grading. Mastery grading is a variant of specifications grading, and falls under the umbrella of "it's important *what* students learn not *when* they learn it". I consider that philosophy particularly important for CSC-151, our introductory course in computer science, since students enter the course with a wide range of knowledge.

Since I've referred to our mastery grading approach in a variety of musings, my muse suggested that I take a step back and describe my current methods of mastery grading. I'll note that I started by using ideas I learned from my colleague, Peter-Michael Osera, but have since modified them based on my experiences as well as conversations with other colleagues. I've also attended a few conference sessions on mastery grading in CS, read some papers, and such.

Two kinds of work form the core of my current mastery grading approach: learning assessments and mini-projects. Learning assessments are small, quiz-sized problems. Each learning assessment corresponds to one of the course's learning objectives (or at least the measurable learning objectives). Mini-projects are larger homework assignments that ask students to apply their knowledge to new kinds of problems, ideally larger problems.

In CSC-151, I give students two forms of learning assessments: weekly in-class quizzes and approximately monthly take-home "sets of learning assessments" (SoLAs), akin to take-home exams. In the most recent sections of CSC-151 I taught, I had learning assessments for [twenty-four different learning objectives](csc151-2023fa-learning-objectives). In CSC-207, my goal is to give a few take-home LAs each week. I didn't meet that goal this past fall. I started spring 2024 with [fifty different learning objectives](csc207-2024fa-learning-bojectives), but ended up testing students on forty-six or so.

What about mini-projects? I strive for weekly mini-projects. In CSC-151, students get a week off from mini-projects when they are taking SoLAs. In CSC-207, students get a week off from mini-projects when they or I seem to need some time off.

Mini-projects and learning-objectives are not the only work students have in my classes. I also ask them to read a few pages from what we might call a "textbook" [3] in advance of each class and then turn in responses to a few questions [4]. They work with a partner in class on a lab and turn in a "lab writeup" that consists of their solutions to problems. I ask them to write [metacognitive "pre-reflections" and "post-reflections"](metacognitive-wrappers-2023-09-04) for each mini-project and SoLA.

So that's five kinds of work: LAs, mini-projects, reading responses, lab writeups, and metacognitive reflections.

Where does grading enter the picture? Obviously, part of it has to do with how I or my graders grade each piece of work. LAs, reading responses, lab writeups, and metacognitive reflections are graded on a satisfactory/not satisfactory/not attempted scale. Although these four categories have the same scale, we approach them differently. If a student demonstrates mastery of a topic on an LA, they earn a grade of satisfactory. Otherwise, they earn "not (yet) satisfactory". In the other three categories, as long as the student has tried, they earn "satisfactory", so they are essentially on a "satisfactory/not attempted" scale.

Because mini-projects are larger, their grading scale as more values: Exemplary, Meets Expectations, Redo, Incomplete, and Not Attempted. "Meets Expectations" is what the name says: They've answered all the problems more-or-less correctly with few stylistic mistakes. If a student does so well that we'd be happy making their solution an example for other studens, they can earn Exemplary. If they haven't yet achieved meets expectations, they generally earn a Redo. If they haven't attempted many of the problems, they may earn an Incomplete.

What about the philosophy of "it's not important when a student masters a topic"? I handle that by permitting students to redo work. For LAs, that generally means that they try another question on the same topic on the next SoLA. For mini-projects, it means that they

**_Postscript_**: I last wrote about mastery grading [three-and-a-half years ago](mastery-grading-2020-12-05). Well, I last wrote a longer musing focusing on mastery grading then. I've mentioned it many times since. Overcommitted readers may wish to compare my descriptions.

[1] Mom was doing that more than thirty years ago.

[2] I suppose the common European (British?) practice of putting all the weight on a final exam also achieves that goal.

[3] Most of these readings were written by a member of the department. In most cases, it was me.

[4] Students seem to read more carefully when they have to answer questions. They are also more likely to read in advance of class if they have to turn something in.
