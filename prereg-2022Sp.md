_Warning!  As is normally the case for my not-so-legendary
preregistration musings, this musing has received almost **no**
editing or rewriting.  Writing what you see already took too much
of my life._

_Apologies: While I had hoped to get this out at about the end
of preregistration, I had too much going on.  It's only four
or so days late._

Yes, it's that time of the semester again.  Preregistration time!
What's preregistration time?  It's the time when students preregister
for courses.  Why "preregister" and not "register"?  Because we
don't guarantee that students who preregister actually get the
courses.  If courses over-enroll, we "adjust".  Adjusting can mean
cutting students.  It can mean shifting them to other sections.  It
can mean finding ways to add other sections.  But, in the end,
there's no guarantee that you'll get courses you preregister for.

Okay, it's not as bad as it sounds.  Or at least it shouldn't be
as bad as it sounds.  As far as I can tell, it's potentially fairer
than first-come, first-served or priority by class year.  And most
students get most of their courses.  But it's a lot of work.  And
it confuses people who are not steeped in it.

And maybe it is as bad as it sounds.  By the time a student gets
cut from a class, there may be few classes left.  Or, more accurately,
perhaps there may be few classes they want to take left.  I know
that some students struggle to find another class [1,2].

So changes are in the works.  No one quite knows what they are, but
it's likely that the current system will be gone next year [5].
For now, we have a few updates.  First, departments and faculty
have been asked to provide cut criteria to the Registrar's office
in advance, so the Registrar's office will be doing the first pass
at everything.  Second, the software that automated some aspects
of the process is no longer functional.  So the always overworked
staff of the Registrar's office gets to do more work.

Oh, they also shortened the length of time that students could click
the "Register" button that doesn't mean what it says.  It used to
be eleven days.  This year, it's eight.  Some faculty tried to do
all of their registration meetings in the shorter period.  I just
started mine at the same time.  So the effects were comparatively
minor, mostly could not click "Register" when we met.  The other
effect I noticed is that more students seemed to still have holds
when we met.  But that could be random variation.

I'm sad that this is the penultimate session for this form of
registration.  The new model will almost certainly be very different.
It will be harder to look at the kinds of patterns I observe.
I still don't understand how we'll identify the need for extra
sections of some courses; perhaps we believe that adding extra
sections isn't necessary.  I don't know what will happen with
under-enrolled classes.  Of course, I don't know what happens with
under-enrolled classes at present.

I'm also happy about some of the positives, or at least I'm
happy about what I hope are positives.  CS is no longer responsible
for figuring out what cuts are appropriate for ensuring that all
of our majors make forward progress.  At least it's not supposed
to be our responsibility.  Perhaps that's a work in progress.  I
seem to recall that the presentation on this suggested that this
semester, the Registrar's office would do a first pass, and then 
it would head back to the department.  In any case, I'm not chair,
so I don't have to worry.

But you don't want my ramblings about the process, at least not
in this musing.  You want to hear what the state of classes are
today, at the end of preregistration.  At least I think you do.
Why else would you be reading this musing?

So let's grab the data.  Our [old all-course
report](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/) [6]
is about to go away.  Fortunately, ITS put in a [new all-course
report](https://odsstu.grinnell.edu/reports/report/RGS/Catalog%20and%20Courses/Course_Offering_0007)
[7,8].  The best thing about the new report?  You can download it
as an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV!  It makes my analysis much easier.
I encourage you to download it yourself and see what you can discover.

I appreciate the easy access to CSV files.  It makes it much easier
to track changes.  For example, I downloaded one set of data at
9:45 p.m. [9] on Wednesday evening and another set of data  at
7:15 a.m. on Thursday morning.  There were 185 changes in that
time, more or less.  I see, for example, that four more students
added Intro Studio.

Whoops.  Strike that.  It appears that the new report system conks
out when we switch from 100 available slots to the correct number
of available slots.  Because of that, I'm going to have do some
estimating.  Fortunately, I downloaded the data as of 10:30 or
so on Thursday night, which gives me a good starting point.

_Note_: If you don't have a Grinnell login, you can't get the
collected data all at once.  However, you can search by department,
instructor, and such.  Just go to the [search schedule of courses
link](https://webadv-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/WAPROD/WAPROD?type=P&pid=ST-X3WSEI)
[10].  I'm sure that with careful Web scraping, you can gather you
the full data set.

Unsurprisingly, many of the normal set of courses over-enrolled.
There are too many students who want to take introductory courses
in Studio Art, GWSS [12,14], statistics, and, um, Computer Science.  Where
do things stand for introductory courses in those four departments?

* There are three sections of ART-111, _Introduction to the Studio_, 
  capped at 15 each [15].  Enrollments are at 16, 46, and 39 [16],
  for a total over-enrollment of 56.  It seems that they could easily 
  offer three more sections [17].
* Art-134, _Drawing_, is over-enrolled by 25 students, enough for
  nearly two more sections.  I believe another section was on the
  slate, but had to be canceled when a faculty member resigned.
* The two sections of GWS-111, _Introduction to Gender, Women's,
  and Sexuality Studies_, were over-enrolled by 26 and 6 as of 10:30
  p.m. on Thursday evening.  Amazingly, they are already cut to
  capacity.  I'm impressed that the Registrar's office was able to
  do the cuts that quickly.  Perhaps the policies were straightforward,
  such as "cut randomly".
* SST-115, _Introduction to Statistics_, had been over-enrolled by
  twenty-three students.  If I had written about it a few days ago,
  I would have said, "I wonder if they can add another section."
  Now I see that they have.  However, it appears that they have not
  yet balanced the two sections.  And, surprisingly, they haven't
  cut the corresponding section of STA-209.  I don't think Chris
  Olsen can teach two classes at the same time.  I hope he won't
  be teaching four classes.
* STA-209, _Applied Statistics_, seems to have about the right 
  number of offerings.  The five sections have 3, 4, 5, 10, and
  4 slots available, respectively, for a total of 26 available
  slots [19].  However, as I said, it looks like one of those
  sections is being converted to SST-115 [20].
* Section 2 of STA-230, _Introduction to Data Science_ is over-enrolled
  by sixteen students.  Section 1 has two slots available.  I expect
  two students will be swapped and fourteen will be cut.
* Section 3 of CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_, is over-enrolled
  by fifteen students.  Sections 1 and 2 have one and four slots available,
  respectively [21].  I've forgotten our priorities here, other
  than "first-years get top priority".  I'm pretty sure we'll have
  slots left over after that cutting.
* Section 1 of CSC-161, _Imperative Problem Solving_, is over-enrolled
  by seventeen students.  Section 2 is over-enrolled by ten.  That's
  enough for another section.  I wish we could offer another section.
  But we don't have the teaching capacity for that.  We will likely
  cut all third-years and seniors, except those who need it for, say,
  admittance to grad school.  But I don't think that will be enough.
  What will happen next?  I'm not sure.
* The one section of MAT/CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_, is over-enrolled
  by ten students.  The faculty member who teaches that class is as crazy
  as I was at their age.  So it may stay over-enrolled.  That's not the
  way to go, though.  Of course, cutting students is also not the right
  thing to do.  Bleh!

Why do we see such disparity in enrollments in some popular classes?
Sometimes, it's the time of the class.  Many students try to avoid
8:00 a.m. classes.  Some try to avoid late afternoon classes.  In
the ART-111 disparities, I expect that it's that section 1 is a MW
class, which means that it conflicts with three different MWF slots.
I won't comment on those here.  Sometimes, there are explicit
differences between sections.  For example, section 2 of GWS-111
is marked as a writing intensive course, but section 1 is not.
Sometimes it's the instructor.  While most Grinnell faculty are
excellent, some have especially strong reputations [22].  And this
year, special advertising went out about some faculty; in particular,
UMOJA [24] posted signs around campus advertising courses taught by
Black Faculty.  The advertising makes some sense; there's evidence
that Black Students benefit from having Black Faculty, and it seems
that not all Black Students know about all of the Black Faculty on
campus.  Did the signs have an effect?  I don't think I want to
explore that right now.

---

Let's instead turn to some of those teachers whose courses always
show up on the top of my "most over-enrolled lists".  Three immediately
come to mind.

_Monessa Cummins_.  ARH/CLS-234, _Greek Archaeology and Art_, over-enrolled
by four students.  That's fewer than normal.  Strange.

_John Garrison_.  ENG-223, _Tradition of English Lit I_, is
over-enrolled by sixteen students.  I assume those will be shifted
to another English class.  PCS-230, _Conflict Analysis_, is exactly
at capacity.  But PCS-230 is a course with a special study-abroad
component and required advance application.  It makes sense that
it's not over-enrolled.

_Carolyn Herbst Lewis_. HIS-195, _ST: Comparative Herbalism_, may
have set a new record for over-enrollment, with ninety-one students
pre-enrolled in a class with a capacity of ten.  It doesn't set a
record for pre-enrollment, since there was an Intro Computing course
in the distant past that, in the words of my colleague Henry Walker,
"had an enrollment greater than its course number".  But it's still
insane.  I hope the College finds a way to clone Carolyn.  And I'll
admit that I'd been hoping that more than one-hundred students would
try to pre-enroll, so that we could break the system.

What about Carolyn's other classes?  HIS-223, _Health and Medicine in
American History_, is over-enrolled by twenty-two students.  HIS-224,
_Sex in American History_, is over-enrolled by seventeen.  My, students
are interested in American history, aren't they?  Time to clone Carolyn
again.

---

We'll get to the over-enrolled courses in a bit.  First, I'd like to
look at my department.  I may not be Chair anymore [24], and the 
Registrar may be taking over our department's cut, close, and balance 
process [25,26], but I still like to know where things stand.

I'm not that worried about CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_.
After balancing and with the normal melt, I expect that most students
who want CSC-151 will get it.

I'm very worried about CSC-161, _Imperative Problem Solving_.  As
I said, CSC-161 is over-enrolled by more than one section's worth
of students.  First-year students who might want to major in CS
should be able to take it.  Second-year students who might want to
major in CS should be able to take it.  Students with special
circumstances, such as those who need it for graduate school, should
be able to take it.  I'm pretty sure keeping those groups enrolled
will keep us significantly over-enrolled.  The Registrar can't solve
that problem.  The only solutions I know to that problem involve a
faculty member adding an overload.  Bleh.

CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and Algorithms_, 
seems to be a bit under-enrolled.  We have three slots available in one
section and eleven in the other section.  It's enough to offer both
sections, but not so many that students will be cut.  That seems good
to me.

As I mentioned earlier, MAT/CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_, is
over-enrolled by ten students.  That's a problem.  208 is required
for two core upper-division courses, and we like students to be
able to take it as early as possible.  And it's not like we can
easily push them to next semester; this fall's section over-enrolled
by four students [27].  Maybe we can just plan for two sections in
the fall.  Maybe we can a mathamagician [29] from somewhere to teach
it.

CSC-211, _Computer Organization and Architecture_, has nine slots
available.  We'll need those for students who have to shift out of
other classes.

CSC-282, _Thinking in C and Unix_, has five slots available.  It's
a one-credit course, so it doesn't relieve any over-enrollments
elsewhere, and cutting it wouldn't give us additional capacity.

CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_, is over-enrolled by fourteen
students, enough to offer another section.  Cutting this will not
be fun.  I hope that we have enough students trying to take two
CS courses who don't need two CS courses that we can cut them.

CSC-324 and CSC-326, _Software Design and Development_ and _Software
Development Leadership_, potentially have about six slots available
between them [30].  I suppose some of the Algorithms folks could
voluntarily switch there.

CSC-341, _Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_,
has two open slots.  Another place to shift students.

Unsurprisingly, our special topics courses are over-enrolled.  CSC-395-01,
_ST: Advanced Operating Systems_, is over-enrolled by six.  CSC-395-02,
_ST: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Systems_,
is over-enrolled by five.  I expect that we'll have to cut the students
who do not strictly need these courses in order to make forward progress
in the major.  I just wish they had something else to take.

---

On to the discussion of over-enrolled courses.  I'm doing my best to
go through the courses over-enrolled by ten or more from most over-enrolled 
to least.  

We've already seen that HIS-195, _Comparative Herbalism_ [31], is
over-enrolled by an amazing 81 students.  I do hope the College is
working with Carolyn and the Department of History to explore how
we can offer more sections in the future.

Section 15 of FYE-100, _First-Year Experience: Connections_, is
close behind, it's over-enrolled by 71 students.  Since it has
a capacity of 25, it is the course that actually came closest to
breaking the system.  This is the first year that students have
been able to pre-enroll in the FYE course.  Given how things
worked out, I wonder if we'll try something different next year.

The next course in our list, PSY-248, _Abnormal Psychology_, is
over-enrolled by a mere 41 students.  (It is, of course, "mere"
only in comparison to HIS-195 and section 15 of FY-100.)  I count
only four other slots available in 200-level Psychology classes.
That's likely to be a major problem.  I have no idea how Psych will
handle it.

Section 18 of FYE-100, _First-Year Experience: Connections_, is
close behind [32], with a pre-enrollment of 65, and an over-enrollment
of 40.  How do the other sections look?  There are a lot.  Counts
of slots available, 18, 21, 10, 0, 3, 2, 18, 24, 20, 18, 4, 18, 23,
25, 18, 21, 2, (over-enrolled by 5), (over-enrolled by 3), 17,
(over-enrolled by 18).  Yeah, that's a strange distribution.  I
assume some of it is people and some of it is times.

THD-195, _ST: Costume Crafts/Construction_, is over-enrolled by 
33 students.  It has a moderately small capacity of nine students.
But forty-two students pre-enrolling suggests strong student interest.

MUS-201, _Digital Music Making_, is over-enrolled by 32 students.
I think it's over-enrolled in recent years, but rarely by this much.
The over-enrollments in this, THD-195, and various art courses
should remind us that our students want to create art, and that
we need to provide such opportunities.  Maybe I'll return to my
"Craft of Code, Code of Craft" course as an SFS faculty member [33].

EDU-101-01, _Educational Principles in a Pluralistic Society_, is
over-enrolled by 33 students, more than enough for another section.
I'm a bit surprised that there is only one section of EDU-101
offered; I thought we normally try to offer at least two.  However,
I see that one is marked as "Canceled", so perhaps we were planning
another.  I hope we find a way to restore it.

ART-111-02, _Introduction to the Studio_, is over-enrolled by 31
students.  We've discussed the College's need to provide more sections
of ART-111 before [34].

PHI-121-01, _Philosophy for Life_, is over-enrolled by 28 students.
I'm happy to see Philosophy starting to move back to its status as
a subject that students really want to study.  PHI-233, _History of
Early Modern Philosophy_, is also over-enrolled, although by only
nine students.  There are only three available slots in PHI-111,
_Introduction to Philosophy_, so I suppose a bunch of students will
need to delay their study of this core area.

GWS-111-01, _Introduction to Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies_,
was over-enrolled by about 26 students.  It's already been cut to 
its capacity of 25.

SMS-150-01, _Introduction to Science, Medicine, Technology, and Society_,
was also over-enrolled by about 26 students.  It has also been cut
to its capacity of 25.  I recall the old TEC-154, _Evolution of Technology_,
as being popular, but not this popular.  Are we offering SMS-150 every
year?  Every-other year?  It looks like it will be a popular concentration.
I wonder how the cuts were made.  I would have prioritized first-year
and second-year students, since they are potential concentrators.  However,
I can see reasons to prioritize upper-division students, since they may
not have another chance to take it.

As we've already seen, ART-134-01, _Drawing_, is over-enrolled by 25
students.  I think I've said enough about our need to better support
the creative arts [35,36].

ANT-104-05, _Anthropological Inquiries_, is over-enrolled by 24 students.
Fortunately, there appear to be some slots in other sections.  If I
count correctly, the five sections of ANT-14 are over-enrolled by 
eight students total.

Back to Studio Art!  ART-111-03, _Introduction to the Studio_, is
over-enrolled by twenty-four students.

Our next CHL course!  HIS-223-01, _Health and Medicine in American
History_, is over-enrolled by 22 students.  It doesn't look like there
are many other 200-level History classes with space, and those that
do have space are not American History classes.

We've covered MAT/SST-115, _Introduction to Statistics_, already.
Although it's over-enrolled by 23 students, it looks like we'll
be offering another section.

PHE-100-19, _Rock Climbing_, is also over-enrolled by 23 students.
I tend to focus on four-credit classes, so I don't know how much
_Rock Climbing_ normally over-enrolls by.  However, I'm pretty sure
that it always over-enrolls.  I'll admit that I'm a bit sad that
PHE-100-05, has also over-enrolled.  When there's room, Coach Jaws
usually lets me sneak in to the course.  I am glad to see students
registering for Physical Education courses.  As I tell my students,
physical wellness contributes to intellectual wellness [37].

ENG-120-03, _Literary Analysis_, is over-enrolled by 21 students.
There are certainly enough slots in the other sections.  However,
ENG-120 is one of those courses in which every section is different.
I hope that students still manage to find a way to study Literary
Analysis that engages them appropriately.

SOC-265-01, _Sociology of Health and Illness_, is over-enrolled by
21 students.  Courses on health and medicine are definitely popular
these days!  I don't think it's just the pandemic; SOC-265 has
always over-enrolled, just not necessarily by this much.  Are there
other 200-level courses for students to take?  Um, not really.
There are 4 slots in SOC-291-01, _Methods of Empirical Investigation_,
2 slots in SOC-295-03, _ST: Environmental Sociology_, and 4 slots
in SOC-295-04, _ST: Sociology of Food and Agriculture_.  On the
other hand, SOC-295-02, _ST: Sociology of Robots_, is over-enrolled
by sixteen students [38].

Those are all the courses that are over-enrolled by twenty or more
students.  At least I think those are.  What about the courses
over-enrolled by ten or more?  If I use my 10:30 p.m. Thursday log,
I get the following list (in alphabetical order by abbreviation).

I think that's it.  I apologize to anyone whose course I missed.  But
it's a lot.  Or at least it feels like a lot.  About thirty courses
with at least ten students per course means that we'll be cutting or
shifting a lot of students!  Some will be easy, such as those in
FYE-100-23.  Other will be hard, like those in CSC/MAT-208.

---

You know what?  I've found something else that worries me a bit.
In the fall, we didn't have enough slots in 100-level courses.
We've already seen problems in 100-level Studio Art, CS, Anthropology,
GWSS, Education, Philosophy, and, if I glance above, Sociology.
What 100-level courses are still available?  Let's go through
the departments and see.  I've boldfaced those that seem to have
available slots.  (And, as always, I apologize to those I've missed
or misrepresented [39].)

_American Studies_: AMS-130-01, _Introduction to American Studies_,
is over-enrolled by eleven students.

_Anthropology_: While some sections of ANT-104 have room, the overall
number of students pre-enrolled exceeds the number of slots.

_**Art History**_: There is room in ARH-103, _Introduction to Art History_.

_Biology_: The number of students pre-enrolled slightly exceeds the
number of available slots.

_Chemistry_: There are 17 more students enrolled in CHM-129, _General
Chemistry_, than there are slots in CHM-129.  But Chemistry usually finds
a way to make things work out, often by adding an extra section.

_**Computer Science**_: CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_, is full.
However, there are slots in CSC-105, _The Digital Age_.  That's a great
course; I hope students will consider it.  (And no, we can't shift the
person teaching that to another CS course.)

_**Economics**_: There are surprisingly many slots available in ECN-111,
_Introduction to Economics_.  Doesn't that usually fill?

_Education_: Full.  Overfull.

_**English**_: Even after balancing, there should be some slots in
ENG-120, _Literary Analysis_.  There are also a few slots available in
ENG-121, _Introduction to Shakespeare_.

_**Global Development Studies**_: GDS-111, _Introduction to Global
Development Studies_, has a few slots available.

_Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies_:  As mentioned earlier, GWS-111 is
over-full and has been cut.

_**History**_: HIS-100-01, _The Prophet Muhammad_, has room available.  HIS-100-02, _After the Great War_, has one slot.

_Humanities_: HUM-101-01, _Humanities I: The Ancient Greek World_, is
over-enrolled.  HUM-195-01, _ST: Material Culture Studies Introduction_,
is also over-enrolled.

_**Latin-American Studies**_: LAS-111-01, _Introduction to Latin American 
Studies_, has a few slots available.

_**Linguistics**_: LIN-114, _Introduction to General Linguistics_, has
surprisingly many slots available.  Doesn't this usually fill?  I know
my students always feel like they have trouble getting in.  It does
appear they've added an extra section.

_Mathematics_: MAT-124-01, _Functions and Integral Calculus_, has space
available.  However, that's the second semester of a two-semester
course.  I don't think others can easily add the course.  I worry that
MAT-131-01, _Calculus I_, is over-enrolled by sixteen students.  And
Math doesn't really have any place to cut to add something.

_**Music**_: MUS-116-01, _Music, Culture, Context_ has available slots.

_Philosophy_: If the PHI-121, _Philosophy for Life_, students have
priority for PHI-111, _Introduction to Philosophy_, then there are
no spaces available.

_**Physics**_: PHY-131-01, _General Physics I_ has a bunch of spaces
available.  The not-for-the-major course, PHY-1116, _The Universe and
Its Structure_, is significantly over-enrolled.

_**Political science**_: POL-101, _Introduction to Political Science_,
has room.  I find that surprising.  Given everything that's happening
in this country and the world, don't students want to understand
political systems better?

_Psychology_: PSY-113, _Introduction to Psychology_, is slightly
over-enrolled.

_**Religious Studies**_:  REL-103, _Studying Religion: Middle East_,
REL-104, _Studying Religion: India_, and REL-105, _Studying Religion,
East Asia_, all have space.  What a great opportunity to learn about
different cultures!

_Sociology_: Even with five sections, SOC-111, _Introduction to
Sociology_, is over-enrolled by about ten students.

_Studio Art_: Hah!  Funny.  No, there's no room.  They could add
three sections of ART-111 and one of ART-134 and there still would
be no room [40].  

_**Theatre and Dance**_: Although THD-195-02, _Costume Crafts and
Construction_, is over-enrolled, there's room in THD-111-01, _Introduction
to Performance Studies_, THD-117, _Introduction to Acting_, and
THD-195-01, _ST: Tap is Music_ [41].

Do the available slots match with the over-enrollments?  It's not my
job to check.

Why are there no language courses listed above?  Because most language
departments offer the first semester introduction in the fall, not the
spring.

This preregistration session seems particularly strange.  I'm not
used to that many over-enrolled classes.  I'm not used to that few
slots in introductory classes.  I know that one thing at play is
that we've asked students who are planning to study abroad in the
spring to still pre-register, just in case their study-abroad program
is canceled.  When they enroll in those programs, space will open
up.

I'm also not that worried about what seems to be a relatively small
number of introductory courses available.  Why?  As I said, we'll
see some melt as students get approved for study-abroad programs.
In addition, there are a wide variety of 200-level courses that
don't have prerequisites, or perhaps only have "second-year standing"
as a prereq.  I wonder if someone [42] will make a list.

As I've said, there are things that worry me a lot (beyond even
the over-enrollments in CS and in introductory studio art).  A
few departments seem to be full at the 200 level, which makes it
hard for students to progress in the major.  Fingers crossed that
it all works out!

I'll see you in a week or two for the post-mortem on CCB and then
in about five months for what may be the last musing on preregistration!

**_Postscript_**: Why did I feel compelled to stay up late to write
this when I have kids home and grading to do and administrivia and
more?  That's a good question.  Maybe it's that some folks tell me
they count on this kind of rambling.

[1] It's much worse for the students who fail to preregister.

[2] I expect that priority systems are just as bad for students
who have to register last.  It's just that we know in advance
who those students will be.  And the students who fail to
preregister?  They may still be screwed [3].

[3] That reminds me.  I have one more advisee who needs to clear
a hold [4].  I hope they manage to do so.   I've just sent them
a reminder.

[4] That comment was written at 7:30 a.m. on Thursday morning.

[5] Perhaps I'll muse on what I'd like the future system to look
like, especially in the context of some of the rumors I've heard
about plans.

[6] Grinnell ID and password required.

[7] Grinnell ID and password required.  You may have to enter
them multiple times.  At least I have to.

[8] I very much appreciate the hard work of the ITS staff who
built this new report.

[9] Yes, I understand that I should have been asleep.

[10] Web Advisor is being decommissioned soon.  I know what we're
providing for on-campus folks [11], but I'm not sure what we're
providing for off-campus folks.

[11] The search feature in Self Service, aka Academic Planning.

[12] Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies.

[14] Some pronounce it "Gee Double-You Ess Ess".  Some pronounce
it "Gwiss".  Some pronounce it "Gee Whiz".  I'm sure that there
are other pronunciations, too.

[15] I've heard rumors that some folks are pushing for the cap
to be larger.  I expect they've never taught or taken intro studio.
There's a lot of attention to be paid to students.  Plus, it's
a six hour per week course.

[16] At least at the time I was writing this.  There are still a
few more hours of prereg to go.

[17] Some of these are students who were cut in previous semesters.
Would demand continue at this rate if we covered all of the demand
in one semester?  I'm not sure.  I expect some students give up on
taking Studio, which is sad, since the fine arts are an important
part of a liberal arts education.  In any case, I'd like us to try
the experiment of having enough sections to meet demand [18].

[18] For clarity, that's a request to the institution.  The Studio
Art department doesn't have much control over such things.

[19] Something that I find scary: As of 10:30 p.m. on Thursday
night, there were 4, 4, 6, 11, and 6, for a total of 31 slots
Five people enrolled in the course between 10:30 p.m. and midnight!

[20] The highly politicized question of why _Introduction to Statistics_
is not listed in Statistics is left for another day.

[21] I'm a little sad that my sections didn't over-enroll.  It appears
that I'm not as popular as I used to be.

[22] I won't mention such special reputations.  I will, however, explore
instructors whose classes often over-enroll.

[23] I should know what this stands for, but I don't.

[24] Yay!

[25] Yay!

[26] The Registrar's office did quickly realize that they need additional
information to make cuts, such as how essential it is that some students
get two CS courses to make forward progress in the major.

[27] Did I mention that I have a colleague who makes similar decisions
to those I would make when I was younger [28]?

[28] And, arguably, those I still make from time to time?

[29] Because it would be magical to find one.

[30] It's complicated.

[31] Am I the only one who wants to call this _Comparative Herbstalism_?

[32] Didn't I just write that?

[33] I'm not sure why I decided to include that in the primary text,
rather than making it an endnote.

[34] That is, both earlier in this musing and in previous musing on
preregistration.

[35] And no, that does not mean expanding the size of the classes.

[36] I suppose I had more to say.

[37] I need to tell myself that more.

[38] I hope Karla is able to keep some CS students in that class!

[39] "Missed representing"?

[40] I'm also not sure that there's room in the building for that many
more Studio Art courses.

[41] Damn!  That sounds cool.  But it's only one credit.

[42] Other than me.
