I post my musings to Facebook, to Twitter, and to an [RSS feed](rss.xml) [1]. Twitter has started telling me about them.

"Nice Job! Your Tweet is getting noticed and has been viewed 38 times."

"Nice Job! Your Tweet is getting noticed and has been viewed 33 times."

Followup comments? Zero. Likes? Zero. Retweets? Zero. I think Twitter has a different model of "Nice Job" than I do.

I don't care all that much how many people read my musings on Twitter. I might even prefer that people leave Twitter altogether. It is, after all, a significantly corrupted [2] technology. I would prefer to measure success in how much I enjoyed writing or learned writing and whether the musing had an impact on people whose opinion I care about. The latter, of course, is hard to judge.

Under forty views also seems fairly small for a Tweet. Of course, I'm pretty sure that the student Tweet that had Raynard sic Anne on me had under forty, too.

Where am I going with all of this? I have no idea. It appears that my muse hasled me astray once again.

**_Postscript_**: I should add a picture. Pictures make these more
popular, right?

**_Postscript_**: It appears that I didn't do a nice job on musing 1218. Let's see ... that one was about Dan and Claudia Zanes. Perhaps I should have used a hashtag.

**_Postscript_**: I'm amused that the one on Graduate Student Strikes was "popular". If I recall correctly, it took a full day for someone to like it on Facebook.

**_Postscript_** Do you want the story about the Tweet that upset Kington? Those of you who get email from me may note that it now often includes a copyright notice forbidding tha posting of that email to social media. Here's why.

Michelle and I had donated to the College in honor of the class of 2020, since they weren't able to graduate in person. We gave some amount per student. A student wrote to me to say that they didn't feel honored by the donation because the College had treated them badly, particularly in terms of earnings as we went remote. I responded, writing something like "I'm sorry that you feel the College has treated you badly." I wasn't paying a lot of attention; I may have left out the "you feel". In any case, they Tweeted my email. Someone showed it to Raynard. He made Anne call me. I think he made other people call me, too. It's been awhile. But it's not like the Tweet was having a huge impact. I guess that's social media for you.

[1] I hope that I haven't broken the RSS feed.
