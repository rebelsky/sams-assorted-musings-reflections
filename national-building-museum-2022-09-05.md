Today I arrived in Washington, DC, for the 2022 CMD-IT/ACM Richard
Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference, or just
"Tapia 2022", for those who don't want the mouthful.  The conference
doesn't start until Wednesday, so I didn't need to arrive
until Tuesday [1].  But it seemed like a nice excuse to visit DC,
so I arrived a day or so early.  I had originally planned to meet
up with some alums or friends in DC, but my planning sucks
[2].

Of course, I was also planning to visit museums.  I have some vague
memory of an old Dennis the Menace comic in which the Mitchells
visit DC and realize that it would take over a year to visit the
Smithsonian if they spent a minute at each exhibit.  Something like
that; I probably got the total length wrong.  I tend to visit museums
by intution on what feels best,, although I usually visit art
musuems.  I think I'll take in the Hirschorn tomorrow and maybe the
Renwick; I certainly enjoyed my last visit there [3].  I also
recall a great Dada exhibit at the National Gallery; however, that was
more than a decade ago.  I should probably visit again.

In any case, today I visited the [National Building
Museum](https://www.nbm.org) for the first time.  Why did I choose
that museum?  I observed that it's open Thursday to Monday, so today
was the only day I could to visit.  And, well, architecture interests
me.  The NBM is not part of the Smithsonian, so it's not always
free.  Fortunately, it was free for me because I'm a member of the
Des Moines Art Center, which gives me reciprocal privileges with
some other museums.

I started with a short introductory exhibit on the importance of buildings
and "the built environment".  What did they say?  Let's see ...

> The National Building Museum provides more than an opportunity to
  explore buildings, their construction, or even their significance.
  Our subject is the built environment writ large: the broad range
  for places and spaces people create to support human activity---from
  simple structures to vast metropolises.  That focus includes the
  individuals, transformative ideas, and technologies that continually
  reshape the places we inhabit.

After spending a few minutes on structures and materials (I enjoyed
discovering that some architects now use cardboard tubes), I wandered
off to the temporary exhibits.

First up ... [_The Wall/El
Muro_](https://www.nbm.org/exhibition/the-wall/).  Yup, an exploration
of the US/Mexico border, along with some other borders [4].  The
whole thing was moving, but what I found most impactful was the
collection of notes from visitors.  One of the posted questions was
"what is a border".  The answer one person had posted (the handwriting
suggests a child): "something that keeps people waay from friends
and family".  Ouch.

Next up ... the [_Gun Violence Memorial
Project_](https://www.nbm.org/exhibition/gvmp/).  Lots and lots of
lucite brick-sized memorials from family members who had died from
gun violence: people killed by stray bullets, people killed by angry
husbands or parents, people killed by themselves, people killed in
school shootings, more.  It also had videos of people talking about
their losses.  I had trouble keeping it together.

After that, an exhibit on _Notre Dame_.  And yes, it started with
the fire of 2021.  I was happy to be reminded that they saved the
crown of thorns.  We used a tablet for the exhibit, which let us
use a host of VR technology.  It was interesting for a few minutes.
However, when I'm at a museum, I don't want to stare at a computer
screen.  I can do that at home.

Does the museum sound depressing to you?  It certainly felt a bit that way to
me.  I thought they should rename it _The Museum of Sorrow_.

Fortunately, there was more.  I appreciated an exhibit on Alan Karchmer, who is
known for photographing architecture.  They did a nice job of explaining why
it can be difficult to photograph architecture and the artistic decisions a
photographer makes.  Some of the photographs were astounding.

I also enjoyed the exhibit on houre and home, particularly the parts where they
showed different mechanisms for building houses across the years.  Plus, they
had an exhibit called "Play, Work, Build" where I was able to listen to some
kids having fun building with giant foam blocks and to spend a bit of time
making my own failed sculptures with smaller foam blocks.

And, like many museums in DC, it's housed in a great building, the former
"Pension Building".

Thumbs up!  I'd recommend a visit.  But bring tissues, at least if you plan
to visit _The Wall/El Muro_ and _The Gun Violence Memorial Project_.

[1] I'm on the Infrastructure Committee, so I'm supposed to be here for a Tuesday
night meeting.

[2] I am planning to get together with alums (and current students) on Saturday night

[3] I'd swear that I mused about my Renwick visit.  However, I can't find that
musing.

[4] If I recall correctly, the number of physical borders between countries
has gone up significantly in the past few decades.
