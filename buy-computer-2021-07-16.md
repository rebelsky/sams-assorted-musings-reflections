The [second musing I posted](buy-computer) was a response to a common student
question.

> What kind of computer should I buy?

I get asked the question by prospective students who plan to be CS majors.
I get asked the question by prospective students who don't plan to be CS
majors.  It may surprise them to know that I don't pay a lot of attention
to the details of computers.  For most of my work, a computer is a tool.
I want a tool that's reliable and easy to use.  I don't care too much about
the exact specs.  And I don't have deep enough knowledge to discuss specs
with other people.  But I keep getting the question.  I suppose it's time
to update my answer.

There are three major operating systems out there: Microsoft Windows,
macOS, and Linux (which comes in many variants).

We use Linux in the Grinnell computer science department for many
reasons.  First, it is part of the Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software (FLOSS) ecosystem, and we feel strongly that FLOSS matches
the goals of both Grinnell and the CS department.  Strong liberal
arts education relies on free and open inquiry.  FLOSS permits such
inquiry.  Proprietary software rarely permits such inquiry.  For
example, you can read and learn from FLOSS source code; you can
rarely gain access to the source code for proprietary software.  You
can usually adapt FLOSS software to other purposes; if you try to
adapt proprietary software to other purposes, you may get sued.

In addition, Grinnell prepares students to contribute to the common
good.  FLOSS, as software available to "everybody", is software for
the common good.  Proprietary software, intended to benefit its
authors, is not software for the common good.

We also believe that using Linux promotes habits of mind that
benefit computer scientists in training.  The "Linux Philosophy"
of small tools working together provides a useful model for thinking
about software design.  It also encourages a mindset in which users feel
comfortable writing small programs to solve certain kinds of problems,
rather than doing things by hand.  From my perspective, that's one of the
key attributes of computational thinking.  We've heard that even Microsoft
acknowledges that benefits to learning in a Linux/Unix environment,
and treats it as a positive when considering candidates for positions.

But we are practical.  I will note that most of the current CS
faculty uses MacBook Pro laptops as their everyday computers even
though major parts of macOS and much of the software is proprietary.
Why do we use Macbooks?  I can only speak for myself.  First,
Macbooks run a variant of Unix underneath, and I want to use a
machine that runs something that looks like Unix.  Second, Macbooks
provide a nicer user interface than most Linux systems; 30+ years
of UI design experience does have its benefits.  Third, some of the
software I need to use runs only on Macs (or at least doesn't run
on Linux workstations).  Whether or not I like it, I need to have
access to some version of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office in
order to collaborate with people around campus and around the world.
(Office 365 may change that.  However, right now, Office 365 Word
is a piece of trash.)  Fourth, I have easy access to virtual Linux
workstations and remote workstations. If I need Linux features, I
can easily connect my Macbook to a vrirtual or remote machine.
Finally, I've been using Macs since the 128K (and have owned one
since the 512K), and they are (mostly) intuitive to me.  That makes
me more efficient.

If I had 30+ years of experience working on Microsoft Windows, would
I feel the same way?  Maybe.  But I'm a *nix person, and Microsoft
Windows always seems clunky to me.  In fact, most Microsoft products
feel clunky to me.  I suppose I might use Windows for the easy
access to the Windows Linux subsystem, which I hear is quite nice.
But I'm used to Macs.  If I had software that I relied on that only
worked on Windows, would I use Windows?  Probably.  But I'd also
look hard for alternatives.

Do I feel some discomfort using a proprietary system, given that my
principles suggest that FLOSS is better?  Yes.  At times I wish that I
could be as principled as some of my colleagues.  However, I must also
admit that I highly value usability and convenience and, for much of my
work, the Mac wins.

What does that say about what you should buy?  I don't know what's
right for you.  I buy Macs.  I tell my family members to buy Macs.
I know that my colleagues (mostly) buy Macs.  Two of my children,
who do a lot of computing, have switched to higher-end Windows laptops.
One of my favorite alums suggests that people buy business class Windows
machines that are a year or two old and install Linux on them.  He
seems to have better skill than I do at finding such machines at good
prices.

I do suggest that whatever computer you buy, you put as much RAM 
(Random Access Memory) in as you can afford (up to about 32 GB),
at least if you plan to do programming.

As always, I welcome comments on this essay.
