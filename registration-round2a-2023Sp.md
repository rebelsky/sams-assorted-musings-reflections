_I didn't proofread/edit this musing, either_.

Today was round 2a of Grinnell's new registration process.  Seniors who were cut from courses had the option to bring their schedule back up to nine credits, on a first-come, first-served basis.

I got up early to see how my advisees were doing.  I was a bit surprised to see that the cuts had not been made as of 6:55 a.m.  Or at least it looked like the cuts had not been made; many classes were still over-enrolled.  They remained that way through at least 8:00 a.m.  It appears that making the cuts was not quite as easy as had been expected.  Or maybe it was just more time-consuming.  Or perhaps I just misunderstood the plans.

I certainly misunderstood the wait-list process.  I had thought that students were not able to add themselves to wait lists until Round 3.  But it looks like anyone could add themselves to wait lists today.  Not many students appear to have done so yet.  It's hard to tell, since wait-list counts don't appear in [the standard report on course offerings](https://odsstu.grinnell.edu/reports/report/RGS/Catalog%20and%20Courses/Course_Offering_0007) [1].  However, you can see them in the [search schedule of courses tool](https://colss-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/Student/Courses) [2].  I'm too lazy to try to do that for every department, though.  I'm even too lazy to write a script to automate that process.

What happened with my advisees?  I have approximately fifteen advisees [3,4], twelve of whom registered for Spring 2023.  Two of them got cut from a course.  In both cases, it was a course they wanted to take for their major.  I'd anticipated the cut for one student.  The other one was a tossup.  Both are now on the waiting list, but thinking about other options.

I'm happy to see that my third-years who wanted a particular CS course (but only one CS course) were able to get the courses they wanted.  My seniors are in courses necessary for graduation.  And it looks like the seniors, at least, will be able to get the remaining courses in round 3.

I'm surprised by some of the enrollments in the broader schedule.  For example, I would have expected more students in both "Country Music" class and "Broadway Theatre".  I expect there are some strange things going on in students seeing that a course is not heavily enrolled and therefore leaving it to round 3.

What classes would I try to take if I were a student?  Certainly those two courses.  Karla Erickson's SOC-295-03, _Sociology of Robots and AI_, if only to cause problems in the class [6].  However, it's at 8:00 a.m. and I'd like to sleep in more.  Oooh!  There's also a Sociology special topics on Social Network Analysis, SOC-305-02, _Social Network Analysis_.  That's at a better time (Tuesday/Thursday, 1:00-2:20).  But I probably don't have the prereqs and it's probably not a good idea for me to sit in an early-career faculty member's class.  I always like taking art courses.  Strangely, ART-134, _Drawing_, has an opening.  However, I expect it's for a particular class year.  ART/FMS-155, _Introduction to Film Studies_, has the same topic as the five or so film studies classes I took as an undergraduate and young graduate student, but I'm pretty sure Film Studies has changed significantly since the 1980's [7].  And I think taking intro film studies puts me on the path to taking ART/FMS-395, _Documentary_, class, which includes course-embedded travel (to Peru this year).  GWS-111, _Introduction to Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies_, is always on my list of courses to take.  And the Capulet course on _Queering Digital Humanities_ (GWS-295-01) also sounds cool.  As long as we're in GWSS, GWS-195, _Living Well Cross-Culturally_, also sounds interesting, if only to take a class from those faculty members.

Damn!  I know that there were others on my list.  Ah, I remember.  I have long-standing plans to take LIN-114, _Introduction to Linguistics_, especially so that I can understand my children.  And SST-295, _Considering Student Success_ sounded interesting.  But this is not a year to take courses, even while on leave.  Oh well, maybe another year.  Maybe when I move to SFS.  

And, in reality, the most important class for me to sign up for right now is on e or more of the PE activity classes.

Enough about me.  Let's move on to the data!  It's now about 7:00 p.m.  Enrollments do not seem to have changed in the pasts hour; at least the report I can get hasn't changed.  I'm guessing most of the seniors have made their changes.  What's happened, beyond cutting classes to capacity?

Let's start with the classes that filled today.

* ART-242-01, _Sculpture_, is now full at 15/15 (it was 14/15).
* CSC-326-01, _Software Development Leadership with Lab_ is full at 0/0.  Read about CSC-324-01 below for more details.
* CSC-341-01, _Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_, is now full at 20/20.  It was at 19/20.  I expect that one of the students cut from CSC-301 (seven students), CSC-312 (four students), or CSC-324 (eleven students) added this.  But it was a senior!  Presumably, if they needed this, they would have enrolled already.  I'm so confused.
* MAT-218-01, _Elementary Number Theory_, went from 19/20 to 20/20.
* PHY-234L-01, _Mechanics Lab_, went from 11/12 to 12/12.  How can someone register for lab but not the course?  Ah!  It appears that one of the students was enrolled in the course but not the lab.  At least I think.  I'm having trouble counting at this time of night [9].

Some classes were cut, but remained over their cap.  I'm not sure why.  Let's chalk it up to instructor generosity.

* BIO-340-01, _Aquatic Biology with Lab_, went from 22/12 to 14/12.
* BIO-375-01, _Principles of Pharmacology with Lab_, went from 17/12 to 13/12.
* CHM-210L-01, _Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry Lab_, went from 19/16 to 20/24.  I suppose raising the cap is a strategy to deal with high enrollments.
* CHM-210L-02, _Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry Lab_, went from 14/16 to 15/24.  Fascinating.
* CSC-324-01, _Software Design and Development with Lab_, went from 31/16 to 20/20.  Since CSC-324 and CSC-326 are co-located, we cap the total between the two classes at 20, and no one enrolled in CSC-326.  I think we discouraged such enrollment.
* ECN-295-02, _Industrial Organization_, went from 30/25 to 26/25.
* POL/PST-220-01, _Foundations of Policy Analysis_, went from 27/25 to 26/25.  It must suck to be the one student cut.
* STA-395-01, _Introduction to Machine Learning_, went from 26/24 to 25/24.  Ditto.

Some dropped below capacity.

* I assume because of the interesting class-year policies for ART-134-01, _Drawing_, there's now one open space.  I wonder what class year it's for.
* ECN-286, _Econometrics_, went from 20/20 to 19/20.
* MUS-219-01, _Electronic Music_, went from 14/12 to 11/12.

One new class was added.

* WIL-110-01, _Spark Challenge_.  Shouldn't that be _SPARK Challenge_?  I thought SPARK was an acronym.

And here are the rest.

* One student enrolled in ANT-103-03, _Anthropological Inquiries_.
* Two students unenrolled from ANT/GWS-195-01, _Living Well Cross-Culturally_.  Why?
* One student enrolled in ANT-295-03, _Human Osteology_.
* BCM-262-02, _Introduction to Biological Chemistry with Lab_, added three students.  Presumably, those were three seniors cut from the class (out of eight cut altogether).  Don't worry, there are still 12 slots left in section 2.
* Two of the sections of BCM-262L, _Introduction to Biological Chemistry Lab_, added students, presumably students cut from BCM-262L-03 (Thursday, 1:00-3:50 p.m.).  Section 1 (Tuesday, 1:00-3:50 pm) went from 4/12 to 5/12.  Section 4 (Friday, 1:00-3:50 p.m.) went from 8/12 to 10/12.  I wonder if those were the three seniors who had to switch BCM-262.
* BIO-252-01, _Organisms, Evolution, and Ecology with Lab_, went from 13/24 to 14/24, presumably in response to the cutting of nine students from BIO-252-03.
* BIO-252-02, _Organisms, Evolution, and Ecology with Lab_, went from 17/24 to 18/24.
* BIO-345-01, _Advanced Genetics with Lab_, went from 8/18 to 7/18.  That seems backwards.  Perhaps someone needed to rearrange their schedule to deal with another cut.
* BIO-345L-02, _Advanced Genetics Lab_, went from 5/10 to 4/10.  Presumably, this is the same student who dropped BIO-345 for unknown reasons.
* BIO-395-01, _Cell and Molecular Biology with Lab_, went from 7/12 to 8/12.  Perhaps that's the student who dropped BIO-345.
* CHM-210-02, _Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry with Lab_, went from 16/24 to 18/24.  Where did those students come from?   I don't see evidence that section 1 changed.  Perhaps some Biological Chemistry students decided to do non-biological Chemistry.
* I'm not quite sure I understand all of the changes to CHM-222, _Organic Chemistry II w/lab_.  Section 1 went from 18/24 to 20/24, an addition of two students.  Section 2 went from 33/24 to 24/24, an expected cut.  Section 3 went from 33/24 to 23/24.  Why is there now a space open?  Perhaps a student switched to section 1 because of another cut.
* The Organic Chem labs changed, too.  Well, all but section 1.  Section 2 (Tuesday, 8:00-10:50 a.m.) went from 11/20 to 12/20.  Section 3 (Tuesday, 1:00-3:50) went from 33/20 to 21/20.  Yeah, I should have listed that in the "still over-enrolled section.  But it fit better here.  Section 4 went from 28/20 to 20/20  Section 5 (Friday 1:00-3:50 PM) went from 4/20  to 5/20.  While there are fewer options for the third0years, it doesn't look too bad.
* The two sections of CHM-363L, _Physical Chemistry I Lab_, both changed.  Section 1 went from 3/12 to 4/12.  Section 2 went from 12/12 to 10/12.  How did we lose one student from lab, but not from the corresponding class?  I'm not sure.
* CHM-364-01, _Physical Chemistry II with Lab_ went from 1/12 to 2/12.  I wonder what course this student was dropped from.  I'm also surprised that students didn't think they needed to register in round 1.  Doesn't this usually fill?
* CSC-151-03, _Functional Problem Solving with Lab_ went from 8/24 to 9/24.  It looks like we can fit seniors in the class, at least for the time being.
* ECN-111-01, _Introduction to Economics_, went from 3/26 to 4/26.
* ECN-111-04, _Introduction to Economics_, went from 4/26 to 5/26.
* ECN-205-03, _Behavioral Economics_, went from 12/26 to 15/26.  I assume the three new students are from Industrial Economics.
* ECN-372-01, _Seminar in Economic Development_, went from 1/12 to 2/12.  I'm confused by this.  Since enrollment in the Econ seminars is predetermined, there's no reason to register for them in round 1.  Perhaps the Econ department should eject these students from the major for failing to understand how to manage systems.
* ENG-205-02, _The Craft of Fiction_, went from 12/15 to 13/15.  I assume that's the one student cut from section 1.
* FRN-102-01,_Introduction to French II_, went from 0/24 to 1/24.  I assume we'll see this increase quickly in round 3.
* I'm too lazy to record the various changes to FYE-100, Grinnell's First-Year Experience" course.  I'm also confused as to why there were changes to FYE, since it's only open to first-year students.
* GLS/RUS-105-01, _Russian Fairy Tale and Children's Literature_ went from 6/25 to 7/25.  I'd told one of my advisees to keep track of this course; I assumed it would fill in round one.
* GWS-295-01, _Queering Digital Humanities_, went from 13/20 to 14/20.  I hope there will still be room for me. [8]
* HUM/SST-120-01, _Introduction to Material Culture Studies_, went from 5/12 to 6/12.
* LIN-395-01, _Experimental Linguistics_, went from 5/15 to 6/15.
* MAT-322-01, _Algebraic Graph Theory_, went from 8/12 to 9/12.
* MUS-101-06, _Grinnell Symphony Orchestra_, went from 11/50 to 10/50.
* PCS 295-01, _Post-Conflict Pathways_, went from 5/20 to 6/20.  I hope that all the members of Congress enroll in this course.
* PHI-111-01, _Introduction to Philosophy_, went from 6/25 to 7/25.
* PHI-121-02, _Philosophy for Life_, went from 10/25 to 12/25.  As I've said before, I'm always happy to see students registering for Philosophy.
* PHI-233-01, _History of Early Modern Philosophy_, went from 12/22 to 13/22.
* PHI-285-01, _Philosophy of Language and Cognition_, went from 5/22 to 6/22.  
* PHY-131-02, _General Physics I with Lab_, went from 13/24 to 12/24.
* PHY-337-01, _Optics and Wave Phenomena with Lab_, went from 8/18 to 9/18.
* PHY-337L-01, _Optics and Wave Phenomena Lab_, went from 6/12 to 7/12.
* PHY-337L-02, _Optics and Wave Phenomena Lab_, went from 5/12 to 6/12.  How can we have 13 enrolled in lab but only nine in the course?  I have no idea.
* PSY-233-01, _Developmental Psychology with Lab_, went from 12/25 to 13/25.
* REL-228-01, _Gods of Bollywood_, went from 3/20 to 4/20.
* SOC-255-01, _Sociology of Asian America_, went from 8/22 to 9/22.  Was this one of the ten students cut from SOC-285, _Contemporary Sociological Theory_?  Probably.
* SOC-295-02, _Sexuality, Gender, Race, and Environment_, went from 13/25 to 14/25.  I have a similar hypothesis here.
* SOC-295-03, _Sociology of Robots and AI_, went from 17/25 to 18/25.  I assume this course will fill soon.
* SST-295-03, _Data Wrangling for Non-Programmers_, went from 2/30 to 3/30.
* STA-209-03, _Applied Statistics_, went from 7/26 to 6/26.  Strange.  I would have assumed that students cut from the other section would have added this.
* WIL-210-01, _Learning from Alumni_, went from 0/30 to 1/30.  I remember when this course had a capacity of 80 or so.  Smaller is probably better.

What have I learned from all this?  I've learned that I'm not going to attempt this on every day of round 2.  It feels like a lot of pointless work.

I've learned that classes with separate labs don't necessarily have to have matched registrations right now.  That confuses me.

I've learned that there are a few generous faculty who increase capacity in some cases.  I'll probably be one of those faculty when I'm back from leave.  However, I'm not sure it's a good idea to increase capacities.  We set capacities for a reason.

I've learned that I don't understand numbers at this point.  There are a lot of amazing classes left that I assume will fill in round 3.

I've learned that students don't completely understand the system.

I've learned that our various systems for reporting enrollment numbers don't match.  For example, if I look up CSC-312 in [Search Schedule of Courses](https://colss-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/Student/Student/Courses/Search), I see that it's over-enrolled by one with a wait list of one.  But if I look in our [course offerings report](https://odsstu.grinnell.edu/reports/report/RGS/Catalog%20and%20Courses/Course_Offering_0007), I see that it's full, but not over-enrolled.  If I look under the "Course Plan" screen for a student on SelfService, I see that it has a wait list of four.

I look forward to learning more.

[1] Only available to people with GrinCo accounts.

[2] Open to everyone, I think.

[3] Why "approximately"?  I still have one who is dropping the CS major and who has another advisor.  I have one who has not yet declared a major.  I also have one who is on leave and, therefore, doesn't appear on my official list of advisees.  The one dropping the CS major doesn't need advice; the other two do.

[4] Why do I have fifteen advisees while on leave?  That's a good question.  I'm pretty sure it's a bad idea for me, but we lack advising resources.  I know that some departments have their faculty keep advisees while on leave and other departments drop them.  Perhaps Council should establish consistent policies.  It would also be nice to see Curriculum Committee establish caps on the number of students a faculty member advises; that seems as much of an equity issue as, say, [the number of MAPs we can advise](map-rules) [5].

[5] Am I a curmudgeon?  Yes.

[6] Just joking, Karla.  I love your insights on these issues and think we could have some productive discussions.

[7] Damn.  I'm old.

[8] I'm only semi-serious.  I don't really have time to audit this spring.  And there's a question about auditing classes taught by ECF.  Still, I'm pretty sure that Prof. Montague has the chutzpah to respond to my comments.

[9] It's now 8:30 p.m.  I'm old [10].

[10] It appears I've said that already.
