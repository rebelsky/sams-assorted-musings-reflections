One of the many questions that new faculty and staff at Grinnell sometimes
ask me [1] is "What are problems at Grinnell?"  One of my answers may
surprise you.

> Our endowment can be a problem.

Now, that's not my whole answer.  It's just part.  For those who don't
know, Grinnell has what we will call a "generous" endowment [2].  I'm
not sure where it stands, particularly since some endowments rose over
50% last year [3], but $2 billion is probably in the ballpark.  With
about 1650 students, we have more than $1 million endowment per student.

There are many great things about the endowment.  Among other things,
it means that we can be a truly "need-blind" school.  That is, we
can accept domestic students without paying attention to their
ability to pay, and we can meet the full demonstrated financial
need of those students [4].

So why do I say it's a problem?  Because when you have that much money
as an institution, it's often hard for faculty, staff, and students to
accept that "We don't have money for" whatever great idea or necessary
thing the faculty, staff, or students have identified.  But if we funded
everything everyone wanted at Grinnell, we wouldn't have nearly as much
of an endowment anymore.  Unfortunately, many people become a bit resentful
when their pet project isn't funded.  I spent many years frustrated
that we couldn't hire someone to run our peer mentoring program,
even though our external review clearly indicated the need for that
position and we provided good arguments and data for the position.

What does that have to do with new faculty lines, the title of this
musing?

Well, for most of President Kington's time at Grinnell, he insisted
that the number of tenure-line positions stay fixed.  And that
creates what is typically called a "zero-sum game".  For one
department to get a new position, another department might lose a
position.  Now, we're told not to think of it like that.  But when
Department A has a faculty member retire and is told "Nope, you
can't replace them" and they see Department B gain a position, it's
hard for them not to think of Department B as taking their position
[5].  Many of us begged President Kington to allow expansions to
allow us to meet student demand without compromising core areas.
He refused.

We now have a new president.  And President Harris has convinced
the Trustees that we need more faculty lines.  She has phrased it
as a kind of "deferred maintenance" of the academic program.  I
believed she identified two primary kinds of maintenance.  New lines
allow us to better meet demand in areas with high student interest,
many of which have relied on term faculty.  New lines also allow
us to expand the curriculum.  President Harris has suggested Black
/ African Diaspora studies as one likely possibility.  President Harris
has also suggested that some of the lines may be used for new ideas
that we have not yet identified.

All in all, we'll be adding about ten lines.

Sounds good, doesn't it?

It is.

But, like our endowment, it will likely create conflicts and resentment.
Why?  Let's look at the positions that we need.

But first, I should mention another kind of deferred maintenance:
We've started a variety of new programs without fully staffing them.
We need to staff those programs, too.  And there's also the issue
of restoring the faculty lines that were shifted under the prior
administration [6].

I will admit that I don't know everything that's happening on campus.
Communication was odd during the pandemic.  And I've intentionally
stepped back from things this year.  But I can still identify a 
bunch.  I apologize to those I have missed.  In no particular order ...

**1--3** positions in _Studio Art_, which, even after staffing
multiple sections of its popular introductory courses with visitors
each year, still has to close many students out of them.  I also
expect that once Studio Art can offer more intro sections, they
will see more majors, which will require more upper-level classes.
And then there's the issue of workload in _Studio Art_.  I don't
think a faculty member should have to teach three six-hour classes
per week.  _Studio_ deserves a two-two teaching load.  Let's take
care of our faculty!  Of course, that might require one more position.

**3--4** positions in _Black / African Diaspora Studies_.  If we're
committing to this area, and it sounds like we are, we need to be
sure that it is appropriately staffed.

**1--2** positions in _Statistics_.  Statistics has been using two visitors
for many years.  Students deserve tenure-line faculty.  And I expect
if we add those faculty, we'll also end up with a separate Statistics 
department.

**1--2** positions in _Dance_.  We have one tenure-line dance faculty
member.  One.  She's spectacular.  But to have a real program in Dance,
we need at least two.

**1--2** positions in _Mathematics_.  Like Statistics, Math has been
relying on visitors for years.  Math also deserves the opportunity
to make its large introductory courses a more reasonable size.

**1--2** positions in _Media Studies_.  We've committed to a Media
Studies concentration, going so far as to identify a building downtown
for it.  We have one wonderful faculty member.  We need more.

**1--2** positions in _Linguistics_.  Linguistics is a popular area
at Grinnell.  We've relied on "shared teaching" of the intro course
and some other courses.  But some folks who teach it have retired,
and others have indicated that they are less interested in teaching it
these days.  In any case, it's popular enough that it deserves
more staffing.

**1--2** positions in _Computer Science_.  Yeah, that's my department.
We are currently the largest department in terms of the number of
majors and have been for the past four or so years.  We are not
even in the top five in terms of the number of regular FTE faculty
[7].  Two years ago, we had eight regular FTE faculty.  We're
currently at six.  We're hiring one this year [8] and expect approval
to hire another next year [9].  But eight faculty is not enough to
support 120 majors [10].  We can barely offer the curriculum for this
many majors with nine.  Ten is more appropriate, particularly when
you consider issues like advising load.

**1** position in _Theatre_ (Literature).  Remember when I mentioned
the positions that departments lost?  Theatrical literature was one
of them.  But that area offers so many possible connections.  I'd love
to see us restore that.

**2** positions in _Language_.  Yeah, I realize that it's not fair
to group those together.  However, while I believe that we've lost at
least two positions in the languages over the past few years, I'm
not sure what they are.  And it may be that it's worth shuffling
those among the languages.  In any case, we need to consider restoring
these.

**1--2** positions in _Biology_.  Bio hires between two and four
visitors each year.  I don't know how many of those are leave
replacements, but it strikes me that that's a lot of hiring to do,
and reducing that burden is appropriate.

**1** position in _Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies_.  I'm
not sure where GWSS stands on staffing.  But I know that they've
relied on visitors for many years and that they are popular.

That list doesn't consider nascent areas (e.g., _Disability Studies_,
_Middle East Studies_, _Neurohumanities_), long-standing concentrations
that could likely use more staffing (e.g., _Environmental Studies_),
other areas President Harris mentioned (e.g., _Jewish Studies_),
the new areas that folks are likely considering already, and so on
and so forth.

Even without all of that, I've identified fifteen to twenty-five
lines of "deferred maintenance".  It looks like a lot of people are
going to have their hopes or expectations dashed.  I do not envy
my colleagues on Council who are going to have to make these
decisions.

**Postscript**: And then there's the issue of providing office
space for all of these faculty.  I'll discuss my earlier arguments about
those issues at another time [11].

[1] And probably ask others.

[2] Thank you, Joe!

[3] For example, Washington University, St. Louis, saw its endowment
go up by 65%.  <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/washington-university-reaps-game-changing-65-endowment-gain>.

[4] What the government thinks they need and what they really need may
differ.  Significantly.

[5] As someone who was sometimes in the Department B role, I'll say
I felt horrible in such situations.

[6] Do all of those have to be restored?  I don't know.  It requires
discussion.  I'm not even sure I know all of them.

[7] I don't know that for a fact.  There is no available list of the
number of regular FTE faculty assigned to each department.

[8] Fingers crossed that the search goes well.

[9] Fingers and toes crossed.

[10] Plus another twenty-four or so Tutorial advisees.

[11] Perhaps not.  Remember, I'm trying to be less curmudgeonly and to
care less [12].

[12] Yes, caring makes me curmudgeonly.
