Today is the last day of classes for Grinnell's Spring Term Two, 2021.
As is usual, I'm both happy and sad to be done with classes.  I'm happy
because, well, it's been a stressful term (more on that later).  I'm sad
because I enjoy teaching, because I feel that there was more that I could
have taught these students, and because it's the last time I will teach
some of these students.  Between HCI-232 [1], which I finished on Monday, and 
CSC-282, which I finished today, I have a bunch of students [8] who I taught
in their first CS class ad have now taught in their last CS class.  I'll
miss them.  It's strange to see them go, but I'm enthusiastic to hear what
happens next in their life adventures.

I've written before about [mom's guidance for teaching the last
class of the semester](last-day-of-class).  At least one colleague
has now adopted that for their own classes.  I don't think I have
a lot more to add about the basics:  Acknowledge the class is
special, acknowledge the connections, remind people to say goodbye.

Why are classes ending on a Thursday, rather than a Friday?  That I
understand.  This way, we can use Friday as "reading period", along
with the weekend, before we have exams on Monday and Tuesday [9].  But
why did we have 36 days this term rather than the 35 we had in the
other three terms?  For that, I have no answer.  I may even have asked.
But, well, it's not my responsibility and it's no longer my concern.

What happens next?  I'm not giving any exams.  But I have a lot of
grading left for HCI-232.  I've never been an efficient or prompt
grader [10], but this term has felt particularly bad.  So, well, I'll
be spending the next few days getting grades done, not least because
I told my students they could re-do any work.  I better get on that!
My research students start on June 1, so I have to get ready for them,
including figuring out how I deal with hybrid summer research.  I
have reviews to do [11].  I promised to do a bit more administrative 
work for the department [12].  My muse appears to be drinking all of
the coffee I'm no longer drinking [14], because she's inspiring me to
write too many musings and too much in each musing [17].  So I'll
be writing.  And yes, I'll be finding things that are fun, too [47].

_Whoops!  As you can tell, the penultimate [48] endnote in the prior
paragraph is a bit of a wormhole.  Sorry.  Moving on._

Or maybe you wondered what happens next on campus.  As I noted,
Monday and Tuesday are exam days.  All work is due at midnight CDT
on Tuesday.  Faculty need to get approximate grades for seniors to
the Registrar's office by Wednesday [50].  Baccalaureate is Thursday,
as is the Celebration of CS graduates.  I need to check the time
for both.  I think we're doing a gauntlet, although that has not
been confirmed yet.  Graduation is Friday [53].  Then they're gone.  Sad.

Then we have memorial day weekend.  I think most people are taking
memorial day weekend off.  I'll probably do more prep for my summer
research students.  And then, as I said, summer research starts on
June 1 [56].

This *should* represent the end of teaching online, or at least having
teaching online as our primary modality at Grinnell.

Why do I say it *should* represent the end of teaching online?
Because we'll still have some students who cannot return to Grinnell
in the fall for health reasons or for visa reasons.  So we'll likely
have some hybrid classes in which some students are online.  I'm
not sure what that will be like.  I hope we'll have adequate support.
Perhaps the online classes will get scheduled in the fancy new classrooms
they build to support such teaching.

We've been encouraged to think about what we we've learned about
teaching online that might translate back to the classroom.  What
will I keep doing that I did online?  I want to project an Otter.ai
transcription on the board.  I'll need to think of how to rearrange
my screen for that.  I first recorded one of my classes in 1995 or
so.  Perhaps I should continue recording.  But how?  I suppose I
could run Teams on the main computer in the room and also put my
iPad somewhere in the room for a broad picture.  That's something
to experiment with this summer.

Being online was good for CSC-151 in multiple ways.  One of the
most important was that it allowed us to enforce the driver/navigator
paradigm.  One student gets half of the problems, the other student
gets the other half.  Whoever has the next problem drives.  That
will be harder to do in person, since we don't want students to log
in and log out.  However, we can still indicate a driver and navigator
for each problem.  And that information is already in the code files
[62].

Taught less in each class.

Generally taught only one thing at once.

Teaching in terms.

Teaching these two classes.

**_Postscript_**: My muse is certainly in overdrive.  The musing
started out as a reflection on teaching.  It seems to have evolved
into something much more autobiographical.  And she certainly wanted
me to spend time writing end-notes or to give you a peek inside my
thought processes.  I apologize [57].  I hope you like spaghetti [63].

---

[1] Officially, it's CSC-232/PSY-232/TEC-232 [2], but I refer to
it as HCI-232.

[2] Hmmmm.  Now that the Tech Studies concentration has been 
discontinued [3], I wonder if I just taught the last course with
a TEC designation [4].

[3] Is that the first concentration to be eliminated at Grinnell?  I'm
not sure.  And it's not so much eliminated as replaced.

[4] I'm pretty sure that I'm responsible for the TEC designation.  When
I started at Grinnell, TEC-154, _The Evolution of Technology_, was
listed in Anthropology [5].

[5] If I recall correctly, TEC-154 was originally cross-listed between
Physics and Anthropology [6].  But then Physics stopped teaching the course.
Of course, all of that happened before I started at Grinnell.

[6] Can you tell that I'm enjoying chaining end notes? [7]

[7] At the point I wrote that, I did not anticipate the level of
chaining that ended up happening in this musing.  Apologies.

[8] I have twenty seniors, more or less.  I'll admit that I can't
recall exactly how many of them took CSC-151 with me, and I'm too
lazy to look.

[9] Traditionally, we have Monday as a reading day and Tuesday through
Friday as our exam days.

[10] My former students are likely saying, "That's an understatement."

[11] It seems like I always have reviews to do.  I've been less good at
shedding those than other responsibilities.

[12] Bad Sam!

[14] Did I mention that I've cut out caffeine from my life? [15]

[15] With the exception of the caffeine in chocolate [16].

[16] Mostly 90% or 95% dark chocolate.

[17] What does she want me to write about?  Here are a few of the things.

* I just learned that I've been at Grinnell about half the time
that Henry Walker has been here.  There's a musing waiting about
that.

* Someone asked about the evolution of pair programming in Grinnell
CS courses.  There's a musing waiting about that.

* Someone asked me about retirement.  I hadn't thought much about
retirement before this year, so I should muse about that.

* I managed to snag a few of Henry's books [18], and there are some
things I want to write about them [31,32].  More precisely, they
inspired my muse to inspire me to write about them.

* I've done some new things in CSC-282 and want to write those
things up as part of the never-ending but long-delayed series on
[thinking in C and Unix](index-cnix).  What things?  You'll just have
to wait and see.

* One of my tasks for the department is to try to coordinate opinions
on our software design class [33]; I feel like I should muse about
that.  Or, more precisely, my muse suggests that I should muse about
that [34].

* The other day, one of my offspring asked why I wrote my own footnote
system for Markdown rather than relying on the standard one in 
pandoc.  Particularly given what my muse has forced upon me in this
musing, she suggests that that's another good topic.  She also suggests
that the disjoint complexity of my endnotes [35,36] might explain some of 
the responses I get to my musings.

* I've started writing about [trying to downsize the amount of stuff
I've accumulated](moving-offices-2021-05-18).  Some musings on that
topic appear to be waiting in the wings, from reflections on why I
accumulate to discussions of things I've accumulated [37].  Perhaps
there will even be pictures.  Oh, I suppose I have a musing to write
about my family's responses to my suggestion that I'm going to start
getting rid of stuff [38,40].

* I still need to figure out my responsibilities as Tapia Engagement
Chair [43].  Musing will help me think through those.

That's eight topics some of which fodder for multiple musings [44].
More than enough to keep me occupied [45].

[18] In both senses.  Henry gave me two of the books he's written and
let me take some classic CS texts from his shelves [19,20].

[19] Bad Sam!

[20] Youngest Son was enthusiastic about getting some of them, including
the Snobol4 manual and the green dragon book [21].

[21] He's taking Compilers this term and already "borrowed" my purple
dragon book [22].

[22] For those not in the field, there are a series of books on
compilers written by a group of computer scientists [23].  The
illustration on the cover of each suggests that particular tools
and approaches allow one to slay the complexity of compiler
construction, represented on the cover as a dragon.  

The first version, _Principles of Compiler Design_, by Alfred V.
Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman [25] has a green dragon on the cover.

The second version, which adds Ravi Sethi as a co-author and changes
the name of _Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_, has a
red dragon on the cover, peeking through the screen of what now
looks to be an ancient PC, while a knight types on a keyboard.  It's
the one I used when I taught _Compilers_ at Dartmouth back in 1993.

The third version, which adds Monica S. Lam as a co-author, has
what looks like a computer-generated purple 3D dragon on the cover.
It retains the title of the second version, making it both the third
version and the second edition.  It was released in 2006.

There has not been another since.  I'm not sure there will be.  Most
of the work on compilers since that time has been about topics not
necessarily appropriate for an undergrad textbook.  Or maybe there
has been work.  I don't recall what the book does about object-oriented
languages or about garbage collection.  In any case, lots of Comiplers
courses still use the Purple Dragon book [30].

[23] Mostly at Stanford, I believe [24].

[24] I'm wrong.  While Ullman and Lam are at Stanford, Aho is at
Columbia and Sethi spent some time at Princeton.  Aho and Ullman were 
also together at Bell labs.  You can read more on the Wikipedia pages for
[Aho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Aho) and
[Ullman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Ullman).

[25] The latest Turing Award winners [26], which is a source of significant
controversy [28].

[26] I should mention that to my CSC-282 students [27].

[27] How's that as a way to tie all of this back to my teaching?

[28] I refuse to get involved in that controversy, other than to suggest
that I understand Ullman's perspective [29] but support the right of others
to object.

[29] Apologies to those colleagues who signed the petition opposing
the award.

[30] Even though the Red Dragon book has by far the best cover.

[31] Believe it or not, but the distracting sub-musing about the
dragon books is not the end of what I can write about old CS texts.

[32] Isn't it scary that the endnote numbers jump by about thirteen
within the same sentence?

[33] Don't ask why I ended up with that task.  The answer is not good.

[34] Did she volunteer me for the task just so that I'd muse about it?
I'm not sure.

[35] Her endnotes?

[36] Why does the term "spaghetti code" come to mind?

[37] I may even do this with an offer to give things away.  Can I manage
that?  I'm not sure.

[38] When she read the musing, Michelle said "We could always build
bookshelves in the attic to move the books from your office and
lab." I worry about her current state of mind.  The correct response
is something more like "You are not permitted more than ten boxes
of books, and you need to get rid of at least five boxes of books
from home before you bring those in."  

When I told my kids about that [39], they said something like "Dad,
we always assumed you'd leave us all of your stuff to deal with.  Don't
worry about it."  I wonder if that means that there are a few dumpsters
in their long-term plans.

In any case, I appreciate the underlying sentiment: "We're worried about
you, and we don't want you to stress about organizing your stuff."  But
I'm at a state in which I *can* start to think about it, so I feel like
I should move forward.  

[39] Well, two of my kids.  But they're a representative sample.

[40] Hah!  I triumphed over my muse.  There will not be a separate
musing about my family's response to my inclination to get rid of
stuff.  I managed to incorporate them into this one [41].

[41] Or did my muse win by getting me to write an extra musing [42] within
the broader musing?

[42] Perhaps multiple extra musings.  One on my family's reactions.  One
on possible musing topics.  One on dragons.  Oooh ... my muse is sneaky.
Or caffeinated.  Or both.  Or neither.

[43] No, I am not responsible for officiating marriages.

[44] Unless those musings take the same form as this musing.

[45] Whoops!  There's one more.  My muse has already had me draft a
musing in response to all the students who have been asking to add
CSC-151.  I'll likely post that one tomorrow, unless I decide to post
two musings today [46].

[46] I decided to wait.

[47] Musing is fun.  Some reviewing is fun.  Grading is not fun.

[48] When I used "penultimate" in class, I was surprised to discover
that some of my students didn't know the term.  At least I didn't
use "antepenultimate" or "preantepenultimate" [49].

[49] Blame my younger two offspring for teaching me those.  Or blame
the linguists, the group who most likely came up with the terms.

[50] Done.  "All of my seniors are receiving an A-C grade or an S."
I remember when we had to affirm "All of my graduating seniors are
receiving a passing grade", which can lead to an interesting situation
[51].

[51] For those not versed in Sammish [52] logic: "If this student fails
my class, they won't graduate.  Hence, I can affirm that all graduating
students will receive a passing grade, even if I assume this student will
fail."

[52] The term "Sammish" is due to Paul Tymann.

[53] I've heard from some students in the class of 2020 who said, "We
were told that if Grinnell had an in-person graduation in 2021, we'd
be invited back for that graduation."  All I could say in response was,
"I don't think that's going to happen and it's not my responsibility [54]."
But I'm sad that I don't get to hand middle offspring his diploma.  Maybe
we'll find another time for their graduation.

[54] I may have also added, "If you really care, complain to President
Harris or Alumni Relations."  Sorry Anne and DAR [55]!

[55] Why is the Department of Development and Alumni Relations "DAR"
rather than "DDAR"?

[56] More accurately, summer research *can* start on June 1.  I believe
we have a two-week window within which we can start summer research.  But
I prefer to start as soon as possible so as to give students (and
myself) a short break at the end of summer.

[57] Did you make it all the way through this musing, including the
endnotes?  If so, let me know and I'll give you partial preference
for the stuff I'll be discarding in the future, at least if I remember
[58,61].  But there may be a quiz!

[58] It's "partial preference" because my offspring [59] get first preference.

[59] Aka "the boys" [60], "the kids", "my three sons", "Youngest,
Middle, and Eldest", "Galoos", and other descriptors.

[60] Perhaps "the men".

[61] Ah, memory.  Such a wonderful thing.  Not always one of my strengths.

[62] By putting the information into a single code file, we can easily
extract the two individual files.  And by "we", I mean "the program we
wrote".

[63] If only today were Wednesday.
