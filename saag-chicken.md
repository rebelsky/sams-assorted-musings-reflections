Saag paneer (a spinach and cheese dish) was one of Michelle's favorite Indian dishes. Once in a while, I'd be brave enough to look up a recipe online and try to make it for her. I settled on [one by Aarti Sequeira](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/aarti-sequeira/saag-paneer1-1927603), which also includes recipes for the paneer and for garam masala. I was never brave enough to try to make my own paneer. But Michelle made garam masala from time to time. It generally turned out well.

One time, when we didn't have saag in the house, I made the recipe with chicken in place of the cheese. Michelle informed me that it was the cheese, not the spinach and spices, that she loved about the dish.

Fast forward to a month or two ago. I was in the mood for something different. I decided to make a vat of the ssag paneer with chicken substituted for the paneer. Saag paneer feels too sad. In any case, as in the past, I didn't have paneer in the house and didn't want to try to make my own. So I went to look for the Sequeira recipe. For some reason, I didn't find it. I ended up with [a recipe by Swasthi](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/saag-paneer/). One interesting difference, at least from my perspective, is that it included tomatoes. This one turned out well, too, at least to my amateurish American taste buds.

Last week, I decided to make a vat [1]. This time, I was able to find both recipes. And so I made a hybrid of the two recipes. I thought I should record what I did for posterity. Here goes.

I suppose I should warn you that I'm not good at exact recipes. I tend to futz around with what looks right or what I have at hand. I have no idea how much almond-coconut milk I used. My spoons of crushed garlic are seriously overloaded. To me, one of the joys of cooking is that you can get variety in the same dish.

It feels a bit strange to say that after talking to someone whose family makes literal vats (two feet diameter ball-shaped containers) of dishes for town celebrations and somehow ensures that each tastes the same. Nonetheless, I'm going with the traditions of my ancestors that you cook with what you have.

* Spices
    * 2 Tbs powdered ginger (fresh would be better)
    * 1 Tbs ground coriander
    * 1 Tbs cumin
    * 1 Tbs tumeric
    * 1/2 Tbs ground cinnamon
    * 1 Tbs cardamom
    * 1/2 Tbs ground cloves
* 4 12oz packages of frozen chopped spinach
* 3 medium onions
* Three heaping Tablespoons chopped garlic
* 4 green chile peppers. _I only had two, so I added a can of jalapeños._
* Eight large roma tomatoes
* About 3 pounds of boneless chicken thighs cut into small pieces. _I've used chicken breasts in the past, but we only had thighs in the freezer._
* 14 Tablespoons butter (one stick plus one half stick plus two tablespoons)
* Around two cups of almond-coconut milk. _The recipes use cream, which I didn't have, or cashew cream, which I'm allergic to. I tend to have almond-coconut milk in the house, and I like the taste it gives._

In a large pot, toast the spices for about two minutes, stirring regularly. _I'm not sure that I should be toasting all of the spices, but it seems to work okay._

Add 12 Tablespoons of butter and melt. _Yeah, this seems like a lot of butter. But it seems necessary with the spices and the onions._

Add the onions, chopped into smallish pieces. Add the garlic. Cook until tender (about ten minutes).

While the onions are cooking, blend the chopped spinach in a food processor until smooth. _My food processor handles about two packages at once._

Add the tomatoes and chile pepper. Cook until the tomatoes are tender (about five minutes).

Blend the mixture until smooth.

Combine the spinach and the mixture in your pot. Add coconut-almond milk to achieve a desired consistency (or a bit wetter). _You expect me to measure this?_

In a fry pan, brown the chicken pieces in the remaining 2 Tbs of butter. The chicken should not be completely cooked; it will finish cooking in the spinach mixture. _I usually seem to use about two fry pans' worth of chicken._

Add the chicken to the spinach mixture and stir. Turn the heat to low. Simmer for about an hour to get flavors to mix. Make sure chicken is sufficiently cooked. Add more coconut-almond milk if necessary.

That's about it. It worked out well. I like the spice I got from the jalepeños. It went well with rice and naan.

What about the garam masala? From my reading, garam masala is cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom. I assume it's more flavorful if it's fresh ground and if you use both green and black cardamom.

[1] Admittedly, I almost always make a vat.
