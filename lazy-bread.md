Late this summer, I started making bread again. Why? One reason is that I like bread. Of course, that's a bad reason to make bread because I tend to eat too much decent (or even half-decent) bread. The other reason is that one of my summer students was complaining about how much they missed decent bread. Strangely enough, the soft, squishy stuff that they sell at Hy-Vee doesn't count.

The last time I made bread with any regularity was, um, probably in the summer of 2012. I only recall because I associate making bread with a student who graduated in the class 2014. In any case, that's the summer I discovered what I call "lazy bread" and which most people call "no knead" bread.

No, "lazy bread" is not quick bread. Quick bread is raised with baking soda or baking powder (or perhaps even beer). Lazy bread is a yeasted bread. It's "lazy" in that (a) you don't need to spend time kneading, and (b) you do it nice and slowly. I don't pay enough attention to the science behind bread, but my basic understanding is that for a yeasted dough, you want to build long gluten strands and then align them. Kneading helps align the strands. Making a wetter dough and letting it sit longer also helps align the strands.

If you look a bit, you'll find that there are a variety of recipes for no-knead bread [1]. The first one I attempted this summer came from _The New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day_. I quickly realized that it wasn't the one I'd made in the past. This one had me make enough dough for four loaves and to refrigerate the dough after a few hours of rising. I recalled making a loaf at a time and letting it sit on the counter for nearly a day. In any case, the recipe didn't quite succeed. Or is that, "I didn't quite succeed at making the recipe"? In any case, the bread ended up a bit denser than I'd like. Still, it looked beautiful and tasted reaonably good [2]. I wasn't sure whether it was that I had not-very-live yeast; after all, the yeast in my fridge probably dates back to Thanksgiving and it's now July.

For whatever reason, I decided to look for another recipe and eventually recalled that I had previously used one from _The New York Times_. It's been updated, but is still called [No-Knead Bread](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread).

Eldest says that I cannot bear to follow a recipe exactly. He's right. I'd liked some aspects of the _NAB5_ recipe, particularly cutting the top of the bread before baking; it certainly made for a beautiful loaf. I also don't completely trust our yeast. And, um, I wanted a whole-wheat loaf in addition to a regular loaf [3]. So I made two loaves. I used 1/2 tsp of yeast instead of a 1/4 teaspoon. I let it rise with the seam side up, rather than seam-side down. Why? So that when I flipped it, the seam would be down, giving me a clean top to cut.

In any case, they both turned out great. The whole-wheat loaf was a bit denser, but I suppose that's what you'd expect. I also added a bit of gluten to that one.

My next attempts included two whole-wheat beer breads. It's convenient that the recipe calls for 12 oz of liquid; after all, that's one bottle. I'd read online that whole-wheat no-knead breads need a bit more liquid, so I also added an extra 2 oz of water. I'm not sure that's enough; I recall reading "twice as much water", but that seems like a lot.

[1] I haven't found many people (besides me) who call it "lazy bread".

[2] One student said "It needs salt". The student I made it for called it "the highlight of my food experience this summer". The latter comment worries me.

[3] My doctor says that I should prioritize whole-wheat bread over white bread.
