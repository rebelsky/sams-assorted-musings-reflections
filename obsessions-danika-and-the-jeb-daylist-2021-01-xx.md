One of the few benefits of the pandemic is that it's much easier
to "attend" live concerts.  In the early days of the pandemic, I
went to a daily show by Grinnell alum Jon Richardson [1].  I also started
attending shows by a duo called "Danika [2] and the Jeb".

My relation to Danika and the Jeb is a strange one; at some point,
I got a suggestion to back their new album on Kickstarter.  They
started out in Iowa (although they are now in Nashville), I liked
the quick preview I heard, and Danika writes clever "please support
me" prose.  I think I supported two different albums, but it may
be three.  I'll admit that the albums got lost in the too much music
that I own.

In any case, I ended up on their mailing list.  At the start of the
pandemic, they started doing regular shows on
[StageIt](https://www.stageit.com/danikaandthejeb) [3] and I thought
I'd check them out.  I also supported them on Patreon [4].  I like
their stage presence, I particularly enjoy Danika's voice, especially
when she takes a soulful turn. Jeb is an awesome guitar player and
delves deeply into his music and sound.  Danika also does a great
job of making the audience feel welcome and narrating the songs.
There are some originals (e.g., "Unlit Match", "You Make A Bad Day
Good", "Sway Into the Storm", "No Hometown") and some covers (e.g.,
"Ain't No Sunshine"; "Some Kind of Wonderful") that I love.  I also
appreciated their weekly reports on the artwork they used as a
background.  Sadly, those reports are no longer part of their show.

So I've been watching approximately weekly, mostly just the Tuesday
afternoon shows [5].  I like the community at their shows; the
comments that appear in the chat, Danika and Jeb's responses to
those, the growing number of folks, including musicians, who seem
to be bouncing between different musicians' shows.  It's also nice
seeing shows with the artists' mothers.

*I recommend that you [check them out](https://www.stageit.com/danikaandthejeb).*

Amazingly, none of the preceding is the primary subject of this musing.
So what is?  Here goes.

A week or so ago, Danika and the Jeb posted a [free signed CD
offer](https://danikaandthejeb.com/click-here-for-a-free-signed-cd) to
encourage folks to watch their videos on YouTube.  I have many of
their CDs, but not all of them.  So I decided to take the challenge.

Because I have an obsessive personality, I decided to take the more
extreme challenge "for those who really enjoy our music".  The
challenge requires listening to the playlist twenty times.  Since
the playlist three hours long [6], that's a lot of my time.  But I
found myself able to put it on in the background while I do other work
[7,9].  At times, I'm an active YouTube listener, adding a comment
on a piece.  But most of the time, it's background music.  I don't
feel guilty; Danika did write "It's 100% cool to listen to this in
the background :)"

There are a few "behind the scenes" videos on the list, including
[a twenty-minute report on a recent European
tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJq98ENEMfg).  I enjoyed them
the first time or two, but I'd much prefer to listen to music than
a narrative.  And at least two of my favorite songs aren't on the
list.

Since I was planning twenty passes through the list, I decided to
use [the last video in the
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGCfi3ZfBqs) to record some
thoughts and to provide evidence that I had been listening.  That
video wasn't quite the right place, but, hey, there were no other
comments on that video and D&tJ did not provide another option.  In
any case, I'll also eliminate them soon.  Because I hate to throw
things away, I've also recorded them here.  I may have edited them
slightly in this musing.

> Whoo!  Made it through the Day List once.  (Well, once and a half.)  You should have "Thanks for watching the Daylist" video to record comments like this.  And what happened to Day Show 2349 (aka [Live at Campbell Steele gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2blPGjW0sdc))?  I know I watched it in the playlist, but it's gone now.

> Finished pass 2.

> Third time through.  Only seventeen or so to go.

> Forgot to record pass four on the Day List.  Just finished pass five.  Only fifteen left!  (We'll see if I make it to twenty.)  I wonder if anyone reads these comments.  I'm finding myself wanting to hear "[You Make a Bad Day Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfVrW9tleGA)" [10,11], [the cover of "Son of a Preacher Man"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9UNZ9QBEac), and more.  On the other hand, I'm finding myself more fond of some songs than the first time through.

> Finished pass six.  I've started to watch the travelogues at 2xspeed.  (No offense, I hope. I love the music, and I liked them the first few times, but I listen for the music.)  And I'm still wondering if anyone reads these

> Finished pass seven.  Beginning to question my sanity.  Would love to see "[Unlit Match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxBD88R0yMo)" in the mix.  Amused that "[Lock Me In Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=910w4ICkj8A)" has become an earworm for me [12,14].  (There are many D&tJ songs I like much more.)

> Finished pass eight.  Wondering why some songs are marked as unlisted.  Bridging out into songs I miss, like "[Open Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WieI4W2Tt9Y)".

> Finished pass nine.  Nearly halfway.  Appreciate that I'm getting some responses to comments.  Wonder what I misheard in "[No Hometown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ix7jlzyKjw)" [15].

> Pass ten finished.  Halfway!  Wondering why so many great videos are unlisted.  (I know they were originally for Patreons, but if the goal is to increase viewership, perhaps the Patreon videos can be released after a few months.)

> Done with pass eleven.  Needed to skip the [20-minute Euro Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJq98ENEMfg) this time, but subbed in (a) [Make My Own Day (Live at 20 Front Street)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puk9gifzOBg) [love the version], (b) [Dreams Held Hostage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6goppFpmuYI) [like the song, can't stand the background noise], (c) [White Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KxUqwwbRQE) [always a great song; I like the backing and the guitar solo]; (d) [The Second Chances Promo Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bRfYZ0LrsY) [I like hearing your narratives]; (e) [a t-shirt promo reel with you laughing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE6cbQ7675U) [um …]; (f) [a plug for you opening for the Nadas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbxBppGhT5c) [sounds like it would have been a great show, even though it's more than a decade ago]; (g) [Living Your Dream, dedicated to Gary Andrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB3ha8yjcHQ) [enjoying it; I hope you move it into the Day List :-)].  Moving on to pass twelve.

> Done with pass 12.  Skipped the Euro Tour again.  Watched as many other videos as I could find.  Here are the quick notes.  [Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVtjjHeYw1A) [Not enough views for such a great cover!]; [Forever Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewWoUfzA_5w) [Love the matching guitars; hate the background chatter]; [Living Your Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB3ha8yjcHQ) x 2 [no comments right now]; [Video Press Kit](...) [10K+ views.  Wow!  The snippet of Bluebird doesn't seem to be from a video I recall-do you have more out there?]; [Son of a Preacher Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9UNZ9QBEac) [at the Mill, right?]; [This Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKqwhWQH9Ig) [I realize it doesn't count since it's not on your channel, but …]; [Try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-8wZAsxzU) [I'm amused about the Alyssa Jacey dialog in the comments]; another [Some Kind of Wonderful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2NIDSO7Hi0) [I prefer the sound of the ArtisTree version and the intro]; [Black Horse and a Cherry Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR1HhSj8js4) [nice cover]; and [Danika Holmes Music Video Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoafUap29IQ) [um …].  At some point, I need to think about ranking my favorite videos. On to lucky pass 13.

> Done with unlucky pass 13 of the Daylist.  Watched some of this pass while making dinner for the family.  (I did that for some other passes, but I thought I'd mention it here.)  I'm beginning to wonder why I log my comments here; perhaps as evidence that I've done each pass.  I'm beginning to feel like an overly obsessive fan.  Should I log Danika's hairstyles?  (No.)  Attempt to transcribe lyrics?  (No.)  Use Audacity to remove the wind noise in "Paparazzi"?  (No.)  Comment on every video?  (Maybe.)  Watch the Day list instead of attending shows?  (No.)  Have a goal of seven more passes through the Daylist to reach 20?  (Yes.)  Become a concert promoter and set up a post-pandemic tour with D&tJ + Hannah + Gemma + ?  (No.)  Venmo D&tJ?  (Probably.)

The unspoken question, since it wasn't something others would understand, is
"Muse about listening to the Daylist?".  The answer is "Yes" and this musing
is the result.  There are times my muse chooses strange goals.  

Back to the log.

> Done with pass 14.  Two passes in one day.  Yay!  I'm sad that I couldn't make today's show.  I've started thinking about which videos are my favorites (and least favorites).  Today I'm also realizing that the big key that Danika shows off in this video looks a lot like our front door key.  The next time through, I think I'll sub in the three versions of "Unlit Match" for the Euro Tour video.  Or maybe the [Live StageIt Broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8).

> Note [18]: I will delete all these comments a few days after I reach twenty passes through the Daylist.

> Done with Pass 15.  Replaced the behind-the-scenes pieces with
  the [Live StageIt Broadcast from Nashville on Nov. 21,
  2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8).  A great show,
  but a sad one.  Wondering what kind of guitar Jeb is playing in
  that show.  Finally tracked down the original of "[Dancing in the
  Snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyeqz0evnlA)".  I prefer
  your version.  Watching "[Pockets Full of
  Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTvYHGEFX8)" reminds me
  that I miss the art interludes that were a regular part of the
  early shows.  For example, I'd love to see the guitar player
  tribute again.

> Finished with Pass 16.  80% done! Watched the 2020-11-21 video
  again in place of the behind-the-scenes shows.  Trying to figure
  out what kind of Fender Jeb is playing.  The shape looks like a
  Telecaster, but the headstock does not.  (Figured it out; it's
  the John 5 Signature Telecaster.)  Next up: Figuring out the green
  Strat-shaped electric [19].  Watched Hannah Woolmer's show on Sunday
  and started to wonder whether you've thought of doing a prerecorded
  video intro like she does.  Not a lot of comments from this pass.
  Looking forward to moving on to the [music-only
  Daylist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyeqz0evnlA&list=PLQK0NqnGJnIgwtYKzwCEyE4nOOa5u_fvQ).

> Finished with Pass 17.  Appreciated the music-only daylist,
  particularly the addition of "[You Make A Bad Day
  Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfVrW9tleGA)", which is one
  of my favorite songs.  The "[Baby It's Cold
  Outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INQ7Z1IrSYE)" surprised
  me; I've heard it before, but I'm not used to it in the playlist.
  On the other hand, I'm not sure I needed to hear "No Body, No
  Crime" twice in the playlist; I'd rather hear more originals.
  Three passes left to twenty!  Then on to other D&tJ music.

> Done with Pass 18.  90% done with 20 passes.  I'm running out of
  things to write.  I also thought I was reaching the point that
  I'm starting to get sick of many of the songs, even ones that I
  love.  Will I still enjoy them at the next live show?  I hope so.
  Or maybe I'm not getting sick of them; I found that I still really
  enjoyed "Sway Into The Storm", "No Hometown", and "Rainy Day
  Lovin'", among others.  Looking forward to tomorrow's show.

> Done with Pass 19.  Only one more to go.  I returned to the main
  Daylist for these last two passes.  No other comments this time 
  through.

I attended the Tuesday afternoon show between passes 19 and 20.  I
managed to get Jeb to talk about his guitars, which helps with
[the video list](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/datj/youtube).
I found myself disconcerted that Danika kept referring to
"Sam is My Muse", but there was another attendee named
samismymuse.  Very strange.

> Almost finished Pass 20 between yesterday's afternoon show and
  yesterday's evening show.  Then life got busy.  But I'm finally
  done with 20 listenings [20,21], right before [the Hannah Woolmer
  show](https://www.stageit.com/hannah_woolmer/) [22].  You [23]
  should expect to see email, Venmo, comments at a show, and a 'blog
  post [24] or two.

> If I watch the Daylist another ten times [25], will you play Dar
  Williams' "Iowa" and/or Greg Brown's "Iowa Waltz" at a Tuesday
  afternoon show?  (Iron Butterfly's "In-a-gadda-da-vida" would
  also be fun [26].)

Now I'm done.  I still love their music.  I've obsessed much too
much about Jeb's guitars (and Danika's).  I've made some strange
comments at the shows along the way.  Did I just offer to watch the
Daylist again?

You know what?  Watching the Daylist 20+ times may have turned me
into an obsessive fan.  Sorry D&tJ!  I'll try to step back a bit.

Oh well, off to work on the database.

I'll reflect more directly on the music and my favorite songs in
another musing.

---

**_Postscript_**: While writing this musing, I found myself linking
to way too many videos on YouTube.  My muse then insisted that I
organize those links and add commentary.  That obsessive process
is taking enough time that I've started a separate musing about the
topic.  Stay tuned for it.  For now, you can check out [the database
that I created](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/datj/youtube.html).

---

**_Postscript_**: Just in case it wasn't clear, the obsession here
was the challenge of listening to the Daylist twenty times.  There
are also some related obsessions, such as with D&tJ's music and the
aforementioned database.

---

**_Postscript_**: Here's the email I sent to D&tJ.

> Dear Danika and Jeb,

> Thanks for setting up the Daylist and for the encouragement to watch
  it multiple times.

> I've now completed twenty passes through the Daylist, plus a few partial 
  passes.  If you'd like to see my 'blog post about the experience of
  listening, you can find it at
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/obsessions-danika-and-the-jeb-daylist-2021-01-21>.

> Now that but since the CDs you shipped on December 7 arrived
  yesterday [27], I think have all of your CDs.  I love your music,
  but don't need extra copies, other than to give to friends.

> So I don't really need any reward for playing the Daylist twenty
  times.  Your music and the StageIt shows are reward enough.  However, 
  if you feel like playing Dar Williams' "Iowa" or your own "How to
  Beautiful" at an upcoming show, that would be great.

> Thanks again!

[1] That reminds me; I haven't been to one of Jon's shows in a long
while.  Unfortunately, they're at a time when I'm normally in a meeting,
teaching, or preparing dinner.

[2] Pronounced "Da-neek-uh" not  "Dan-ick-uh".  You can hear the
pronunciation at the start of "[You Make a Bad Day Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfVrW9tleGA)".

[3] They may have already been doing regular shows on StageIt.

[4] Sorry Micki.

[5] Evenings and weekends are usually family time.

[6] It used to be longer; they eliminated the [one-hundred minute live
show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2blPGjW0sdc), or at least subbed
in some shorter videos.

[7] This week, my "other work" has been class prep and administrivia [8].

[8] Some of my "other work" ended up being these musings.

[9] There are some songs that I love enough that it's hard not to 
look up and watch.

[10] No, I did not include links to the originals in my comments.  But
this musing felt incomplete without them.  As I said, I'm somewhat obsessive.

[11] No, I did not have links to endnotes in the original comment.

[12] "Lock Me In Tonight" feels more like traditional mainstream modern
country than most of Danika's songs.  I prefer the more soulful songs
or the ones with deeper meaning.

[14] In my world, an earworm is a song you can't get out of your head.
I woke up hearing Danika sing "Lock Me In Tonight" two days in a row.

[15] I had written something like "I love the way you sing 'Cotton' in 
this song" [16] and got a big "Huh?" as a response [17].  

[16] Rhymed with "forgotten".

[17] I have since confirmed that I heard the lyric correctly.

[18] The note was part of my Pass 14 post.

[19] It's a Fender, too.

[20] Also endnote 20.

[21] Now is 1:55 p.m., CST, 2021-01-20.

[22] Hannah Woolmer is part of a group of musicians who seem to bounce
between each others shows.  I *think* it started with Hannah visiting
a Danika and the Jeb show.  I seem to recall her being mentioned on
[the 2020-11-21 show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZkP-LYrd8)

[23] In case it's not clear, "You" is "Danika and the Jeb".

[24] That's this post.

[25] I was going to say "twenty", but I don't think I could make it
through another twenty passes.

[26] Jeb talked about it at one of their shows.  I don't recall why.

[27] January 20.  Yay USPS!
