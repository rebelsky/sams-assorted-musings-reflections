The other day, I received an email from a colleague at another institution that included a signatory note that indicated that they are now a "Title IX Mandatory Reporter". I cringed a bit at that signature because Michelle always used to remind us that "Mandatory Reporter" has historically been a term reserved for those mandated by law to report child abuse [1] (e.g., physicians, social workers, police officers). Attaching the term to "Title IX" confuses the matter.

Generally, those who say that they are "Title IX mandatory reporters" mean that their institution requires them to report cases of sexual assault when they become aware of such cases. Is that a legal requirement, with the same force as child abuse reporting? Not really. While it might be considered a legal requirement, as per various "Dear Colleague" and other advisory letters from the United States Department of Education, in the end, the onus is on the institution, not the individual.

I checked out my colleague's "more info" page on their "Mandatory Reporter" statement. It reads something like the following.

> I am one of the my institution's Title IX Officials Required to Report. If I learn of sex- or gender-based violence, harassment, or discrimination, I am required to report the incident to my institution's Title IX office, including any names or details I have.

I'm not surprised that they are required to report. At Grinnell, all faculty (and almost all peer educators) are required reporters. Perhaps at their institution, not all faculty must report such issues. Perhaps Grinnell is overly conservative in this matter. 

In any case, I don't see the word "mandatory" there. "Required", yes. "Mandatory" or "Mandated", no. Why can't they call themselves a "Required Reporter"? Certainly, the difference in policies between institutions suggests that this is an institutional requirement, rather than a legal mandate.

I thought about sending my colleague a note to that effect. Maybe I still will. Or perhaps I'll send them a link to this musing. Perhaps they already read my musings. You never know.

I also did a bit more research (at least if you consider a Web search research). And it turns out that people mandated to report child abuse are often referred to as "Mandated Reporters". See, for example, the [Wikipedia page on Mandated Reporters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandated_reporter). However, at least in Iowa, the state government also uses the term "Mandatory Reporter" . See, for example, this [statement from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services](https://hhs.iowa.gov/report-abuse-fraud/mandatory-reporters).

It's essential that mandated reporters report child (and dependent adult) abuse. It's also important that Title IX required reporters report gender/sex-based violence, harassment, or discrimination. But they are very different kinds of reporting. Is it that hard to reserve the "mandatory" term for those whose mandate is reporting child (and dependent adult) abuse?

If you see someone say that they are a "Title IX Mandatory Reporter", I hope you'll drop them a friendly note suggesting that they call themselves a "Title IX Required Reporter". Perhaps you can even point them to this musing.

In case you didn't ??? it from the text above, I am a Title IX required reporter for incidents at Grinnell. If I am told or hear of an instance of sex- or gender-based violence, harassment, or discrimination, I must report it to our Title IX office.

For details, see [Grinnell College Policy, Procedures and Guide to Preventing, Reporting, and Responding To Sexual Misconduct and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2024-01/Grinnell%20College%20Guide%20for%20Prohibited%20Behavior%2001.2024%20FINAL.pdf) [2]. In particular,

> To meet these goals, with the exception of designated confidential resources, staff and faculty members and designated student leaders are required to share disclosures of Prohibited Behavior with the Title IX Coordinator.

That reminds me: I should probably add a note about that to my syllabus.

[1] Also abuse of dependent adults

[2] I'm not sure why the short title of that document is "Grinnell College Guide for Prohibited Behavior". I suppose that's better than "Grinnell College Guide to Prohibited Behavior".

[3] I'm also not sure why we use the Oxford comma in one part of that title, but not another.
