*Warning! It's another maudlin musing.*

Two days ago, I went to see [Jonathan Richman live at the Englert Theatre](jonathan-richman-2025-10-18). I've written about the show, which was fantastic. But my muse also calls me to write about my deeper emotional responses to seeing a show without Michelle.

When I heard that Jonathan was coming to Iowa, I knew that I'd go. Or that I'd try to go. And when I checked at the Englert site, I was happy to see that there were still third-row seats available [1]. And then came the difficulties. None of my normal concert-going friends were available. Normally, that would have meant buying tickets for just Michelle and myself. However, Michelle can no longer attend. Or no longer attend physically; perhaps she's there in spirit.

Anyway, I'm larger than I'd like to be, so I always worry about sitting next to people and imposing on their space. It's okay if it's only on one side, but it's harder if it's on both sides. Music should also be shared. So I had my first question: Should I buy two seats and hope to find one friend to come with me, or should I buy two, and hope to find a couple? Or should I just suck it up and go by myself? I decided to buy two tickets; I have a friend I meet with once a month, and I thought they'd be willing to go. And, as I expected, they were happy to meet me there.

As I said in [that earlier musing](jonathan-richman-2025-10-18), Michelle really enjoyed Jonathan's music and had loved seeing him the one time we did so together. It would have been great to bring her again. She would have been pissed at me about taking pictures, but she would have enjoyed the show.

Jonathan shows are wonderful. And so I laughed, clapped, and sang along as best I could. That kept me in decent spirits.

However, some things were really hard.

I'm used to reaching over and holding Michelle's hand. Or having Michelle reach over and grab mine. It's a small thing, but there's such comfort in holding your partner's hand as you enjoy a show. Also the small glances to share joy in the concert or something the performer said. And putting my arm around her. So there were times I felt like I should just reach to my right, where should be sitting. But she wasn't there. And she'll never be there. I'm glad that my main focus was "It would be inappropriate to grab your friend's hand like you grabbed Michelle's; be careful of unconscious habits" rather than "I'll never hold her hand at a show again". Even the wonder of a Jonathan Richman show could not offset such deep sadness. I'm sobbing uncontrollably now as I think of it.

The ride home was also more difficult than I expected. I miss the opportunity to debrief with Michelle about shows.

[1] Given the number of times Jonathan stepped away from the mic, I was particularly happy to have purchased such seats.
