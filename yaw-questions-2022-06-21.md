As [I've recently written](yaw-2022-06-20), this past weekend was Young
Alumni Weekend at Grinnell College.  Unsurprisingly, when I see alums,
they have lots of questions.  Since not everyone got to ask questions,
particularly since not everyone was there, I thought I'd reproduce and
extend some of the questions and my answers here.

**Is the CS department still growing?**

_This one is a bit hard to answer, since it's based, in part, on when
someone graduated.  A few attendees at this year's YAW were here when
we still had 12--15 CS graduates per year.  A few were in the first two
years of the giant growth [1].  But, although the hockey stick has 
leveled out, we're still growing.  At least I think we are.  So what did
I say?_

Things have leveled out a bit.  It looks like we currently have 65 or
so majors in the class of 2024, which just declared.  I expect we'll
get a few more double majors.

Unfortunately, faculty growth has not kept up.  This was a particularly
bad year.  We have somewhere about three faculty on leave next year [2].
We had trouble hiring visitors.  Since we didn't want to cancel classes
if we didn't hire, we ended up closing a lot of students out of courses
they wanted to take.  There are even some of the rising third-years who
have no CS courses in the fall.  We hope to get that fixed now that we
have a signed contract.

**Why isn't the College growing the CS faculty?**

_I'm not sure that I can give a polite answer to this question._

I'm not sure.  I'm trying to step back from those issues.

**Are there new faculty since I've been here?**

Yes.  We have some great new faculty.  Faculty Member One just finished
their third year.  They do really cool stuff at the border of math and
CS, mostly on networks.  They've also been very creative on making the
classroom more inclusive.  Faculty Member Two just finished their second
year.  They do things between AI and Ethics, mostly considering agent-based 
systems for exploring the development of ethical principles, at least as
I understand it.  And they're as crazy as I am; they took eight research
students this summer.  We have two awesome visitors and we're expecting
a third one to join us in the fall.  We've also hired a new theoretician
in the fall, one who does research that asks some important societal
questions.

Plus, PM and Charlie just got tenure! [4]

**How are you doing?**

_This one is a bit hard to answer, too.  Do they know that I've had
a heart attack?  It's not really something I want to bring up in 
casual conversation.  So I give an answer that covers the main point._

I'm alive. I'm great.

_And that's basically true.  I am thrilled to be alive.  And, in general,
I'm positive about a lot of things._

I've stepped back from administrative responsibilities, and that's making
a big difference.

**Do you have students this summer?**

I'm taking this summer off from summer research students.

**So what are you doing with your summer?**

My wife's job is two hours west of here.  I'm living with my wife.

**I overheard that you're on leave this coming year.  What are you doing this year?**

_That requires a musing.  Stay tuned._

My health is my priority.  I plan to walk a lot and read some good books.

And I'm going to live with my wife.

**How are Mr. Stone and Mr. Walker?**

_Mr. Stone would not want information about him posted on the Interweb._

Mr. Walker is having trouble slowing down.  He's visiting faculty
at Sonoma State University.  He's also getting involved in curriculum
design there.

I miss them both.  It's strange thinking of myself as the most senior
CS faculty member.

**When are you retiring?**

_Isn't that a fascinating question?  Is that "I worry about you; I
hope you're planning a more sensible life" or "You're probably dead
wood by now; when are you getting out of the classroom?  Or maybe
it's a reaction to "It's strange thinking of myself as the most
senior CS faculty member"._

I just turned 58 [5].  I'm eligible to start Senior Faculty Status at
age 61.  So I have a few years before I start thinking too much about
it.  And, given what's happening with the economy, I may stay teaching
a bit longer than I had planned.  We'll see how I feel after this year.

**What are your current research projects?**

I've been working on MIST, the Mathematical Image Synthesis Toolkit
[6].  MIST provides a graphical yet functional approach to image
making.

I feel like it's time to revisit the image-based CSC-151, although
without GIMP.  I'll probably spend some time working on that
curriculum.

**How are your kids?**

Middle is here for YAW.  You should ask him.  He lives about five hours
away.  Eldest is on the east coast in graduate school.  He's sorry that
he couldn't make it back here.  Youngest is in college on the west coast.
It sucks having them so far away, but it's good to see them grow, and I'm
proud of what they are doing.

**Are you going to return to daily musing?**

_Strangely enough, no one asked this question.  I'm answering it
anyway._

I've found it hard to muse of late.  During the semester, I was too
busy, and sleep took precedence [7].  Many of my musings have been
rant-like [8]---or at least rant adjacent---and I'm trying to take
a more positive outlook on life.  And writing has been harder.

But I enjoy writing [9].  And I'm on leave.  So I hope to return to
some semblance of regular musing.  Perhaps even daily musings.  We
shall see.

[1] 35 then 45, I think.

[2] Two full year leaves, two half-year leaves [3], one extra course
reduction.

[3] Maybe only one.

[4] That's public information, so I don't mind sharing it here.

[5] On Friday of YAW, believe it or not.

[6] One of the alums back for YAW said "I can't believe I named it that."
And they are correct, I let them name it.  But it needed a name.

[7] Work did too.  

[8] No, not rat-like.

[9] I hope that it's not just that I enjoy ranting.
