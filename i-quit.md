Dear Elaine,

I see that Council has once again failed to provide CS with adequate
staffing.  I realize that there are many factors that go into
that decision, including the Trustees' decision not to expand the
faculty and significant needs in many other department. However,
we have suffered through six years of understaffing that have added
significant stress to the faculty in the department, led to at least
one resignation, and have given our students a less good education
than the deserved.  And we've done this while still trying to
maintain an excellent program.

In any case, I cannot continue to Chair a department for which the
College regularly refuses to provide even barely adequate resources;
doing so would further damage my mental, emotional, spiritual, and
physical health.  I resign from my position as Chair, effective
immediately.

I realize that because I am resigning after one year of serving as
Chair, I will receive no compensation for this incredibly taxing
year.  I would rather do without compensation than continue to have
to fight what appears to be a pointless fight.  I'm done fighting.

Given the burdens the College has explicitly and implicitly placed
on the department, I do not expect that Jerod Weinman will be willing
to resume the role of Chair.  Hence, I encourage you to appoint
someone from outside the department to Chair Computer Science for
at least the next year; perhaps one of the Associate Deans will be
willing to serve that role.  Note that this person will also need
to chair five faculty reviews next year, lead the department in
providing learning outcomes for all of our courses, and complete
the documentation of departmental policies and procedures that we
have been called upon to provide.  I expect that they will also
have to continue to address the troublesome effects of ITS and
institutional technology policies on our department.  Other roles
they might not expect include handling the over-enrollments in most
of our required courses and distributing advisees equitably among
the faculty.

I would also encourage them to work with the Dean's office on
long-term planning for our department, including issues of not just
staffing, but also equity and inclusion, space, and appropriate
advising loads.

Stepping down as Chair means that I will have more time to mentor
our early-career faculty in their teaching.  I will, of course,
contribute to faculty reviews in my role as tenured member of the
department and will chair one review if asked to do so.  I expect
Jerod will chair one other.  I expect that the new Department Chair
will chair the remaining three reviews.

I am currently scheduled for 4.5 classes next year.  I would be happy
to work with the new Chair on what else to teach.  Perhaps a section
of CSC-312, which we have not been able to offer in a few years.

I would also be happy to provide the new Chair with an approximate list
of the outstanding tasks for this year and the Chair's handbook that
I prepared the last time I passed on the role of Chair.

In any case, I look forward to working with our new Chair when you
appoint them.  Given the regular tasks that come to the Chair from
throughout the College, I encourage you to appoint them as soon as
possible.

Regards,
