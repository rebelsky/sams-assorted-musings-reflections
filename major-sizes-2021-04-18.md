_What's the largest major at Grinnell?_

I've been asked that question a few times in the past week.  An alum asked
because they wanted to put the question in a quiz bowl.  A son asked [1].
I feel like it came up somewhere else, too.

Anyway, it's not a question that I can answer easily.  Why?  First
of all, I don't have access to the official data, so I can only
rely on the Campus Directory.  Students do not allow
their information in that directory [2].  So the numbers I normally
use aren't quite right.  Second, many students are on leave this
year, so they do not appear in the directory.  I'm not even sure
they appear in official counts; they certainly weren't counted when
I received counts of major advisees from the Registrar's office.
But we had a lot of third-year (and other) students on leave [3].
Third, even in a normal year students change majors, declare second
majors and third majors [4], and so on and so forth.  So counts are
not consistent.

But we'll assume that the directory data are representative, if not
exact.  This is also a reasonable time to check for majors; second-year
students should have declared their majors [5].  

Oh, yeah, there's a further complication.  How do you deal with
Biological Chemistry?  It's not its own department.  It's one of
the larger majors all by itself.  And Biology is another of those
larger majors.  If we add them together---or even add half of the
Biol. Chem.  majors to Biology---then the Biology department has the
largest number of majors.  Oh well.  That's for someone else to
decide.  I'll keep them separated by official major.

I'm going to start with the numbers in each class.  According to
the directory, 313 students remain in the class of 2021, 373 are
currently in the class of 2022, and 385 in the class of 2023.  Of
course, this year also represents a higher-than-normal number of
mid-year graduates, so the numbers for the class of 2021 are low.

Now let's look by major.

<table class="table">

    <th>Major</th>
    <th>2021</th>
    <th>2022</th>
    <th>2023</th>

  <tr> <td>Physics</td> <td>18</td> <td>19</td> <td>20</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Political Science</td> <td>26</td> <td>33</td> <td>30</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Psychology</td> <td>28</td> <td>31</td> <td>23</td> </tr>

  <tr> <td>Sociology</td> <td>28</td> <td>22</td> <td>33</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Spanish</td> <td>24</td> <td>15</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Studio Art</td> <td>9</td> <td>13</td> <td>9</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Theatre and Dance</td> <td>6</td> <td>3</td> <td>6</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Undeclared</td> <td>0</td> <td>-</td> <td>13</td> </tr>
</table>

There are some fascinating bits of information buried in all that.
For example, three of the five Music majors in the class of 2021
are also Physics majors.  And we have two History/Art History double
majors [7].  I don't know what to do with the variability in the
size of the Mathematics major.

So, to answer the original question;  If we believe that the Campus
Directory data are representative and we ignore the Biology and
Biological Chemistry confluence, then CS is the largest major at
Grinnell, with Econ an incredibly close second in the class of 2023.

I've been saying for a few years that we are graduating approximately
sixty CS majors per year.  None of the CS numbers are at 60.  But,
as I said, we have mid-year graduates and we have about twenty
students on leave.  I'm pretty sure that if you add those in, we'd
be at about sixty a year.  And I know we have some planned double
majors in the class of 2023.  What worries me [8] is that when we
add in the students in the class of 2022 who are now in the class
of 2023, we'll be over sixty.  Most of the required classes can
only handle sixty students in any one year.  Oh well, that's an
issue for another day [9].

For fun, let's see what the percentages look like for some of the larger
majors.  I've ordered these by class of 2023 numbers.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Major</th>
    <th>2021</th>
    <th>2022</th>
    <th>2023</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <td>Computer Science</td> <td>.140</td> <td>.129</td> <td>.138</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Economics</td> <td>.112</td> <td>.107</td> <td>.135</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Biology</td> <td>.102</td> <td>.091</td> <td>.096</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Biological Chemistry</td> <td>.073</td> <td>.118</td> <td>.086</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Sociology</td> <td>.089</td> <td>.0589</td> <td>.086</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Political Science</td> <td>.083</td> <td>.084</td> <td>.078</td> </tr>
</table>

Fascinating.  In any case, I think I can continue to give the same
answer I've been giving: "CS is the largest major at Grinnell".
Believe it or not, I wish we weren't.

Hmmm.  All of this reminds me that I need to post my semesterly 
end-of-preregistration post this coming Saturday.  More fun!

[1] Well, a son implied the question.  I think they asked "Do you
think you're going to pass Econ as the largest major?"  Of course,
I think we passed Econ a few years ago.

[2] I believe it's a small fraction of our students, but I do not know
how small or large a fraction it is.

[3] I count approximately twenty CS majors on leave this spring.

[4] Yes, triple majors are becoming a thing at Grinnell.  I believe that
I was told that they don't even require special permission anymore.

[5] The directory suggests that only 13 of 385 have not.

[6] Are you wondering about those independent majors?  I know I always
like to see the list.  The class of 2021 has independent majors in
Urban Planning and Design, Jewish and Israeli Studies, Agriculture
and Sustainable Development, Creative Writing and Film, Health
Science Writing, and Narrative Studies.  The class of 2022 has
independent majors in Global Environmental Studies, International
Relations (three of 'em), Environmental Justice, Health Narratives,
and Mathematical Models of Language.  The class of 2023 has independent
majors in Cooperative Systems, New Frontiers of Art, Medical
Humanities, Integrative Health, and Higher Education Administration
and Policy.  Aren't those cool?

[7] I only noticed that because the directory listing of History
majors also includes Art History majors, so I have to do a manual
recount.  I am not criticizing the double major; it strikes me that
Math/CS or Math/Physics are probably as close to each other.

[8] Or, more precisely, what would have worried me if I were Chair
right now.

[9] And for another person.
