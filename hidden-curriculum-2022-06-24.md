This week, I participated in a workshop on The Hidden Curriculum.
I've always thought about the Hidden Curriculum primarily in terms
of the hidden aspects of college, the things that are "understood"
but not always said explicitly, the things some students learned
in high school and others didn't.  It's problematic because not
knowing things disadvantages you.

For example,

* If you don't know what "Office Hours" are, you won't take advantage
  of them.  There's evidence that some students think of "Office Hours"
  as "Faculty Protected Time" rather than "Time Faculty are explicitly
  available to students".
* If you haven't learned [1] how to read a syllabus, you will not be able
  to extract/take advantage of the relevant information [2].
* If you don't reciever explicit rubrics, or you don't know what a
  rubric is, you may have significantly more difficulty meeting
  faculty expectations.
* If you don't understand something in a reading, you're generally not 
  supposed to skip over it.  Depending on the situation, you might
  be expected to ask a peer, ask your professor, or do follow-up
  research [3].

As a few colleagues said, "For some students, it feels like there was a
memo that other people got but they didn't."

In the workshop, I learned that there are really Hidden Curricula,
plural, although I wouldn't choose to call them that.  There's a
Hidden Curriculum on how you're supposed to behave as a junior
faculty member (e.g., building a list of people who can serve as
reviewers, knowing how to get invited to join an NSF panel).  There
are also Hidden Curricula in how you behave in different situations:
at a concert, at a formal dinner, at the bowling alley.

I took the workshop primarily to explore how to better address the
Hidden College Curriculum for students.  But we've been spending a
lot of time on other Hidden Curricula, too.  Our assignment for the
third day of the workshop asked us to reflect on them.  Let's see.
What were the questions?

* Identify a topic or area of hidden curriculum present in a broader context (Department, Division, Academic Field, Campus, etc.) you would like to discuss.
* See if you can pick up on norms or values that are held by the College but not documented or written down.

Or is that one question with a follow-up?  I'm not sure; I wasn't at the
workshop when the questions were asked [4].  I'm not even sure whether
we can choose more than one, which is always my temptation.  

So, let's go.

One of the most important aspects of the Hidden Curriculum I see
for our students is the particular details of each faculty member's
expectations, policies, and behaviors.  Which ones will grant you
an extension if you just ask?  Which will grant you an extension
if you give a good rationale?  Which ones will start penalizing you
the instant after the assignment is due?  Which ones will pay more
attention to issues of academic honesty, and what particular policies
will they care about?  Which ones will answer email at off hours
(yes, I know that's generally considered a bad practice, but students
sometimes need help during off hours)?  Which ones are okay if you
drop by their office just to shoot the breeze?  What documentation
do they expect for various issues?  What do they mean by "excused
absence" and "unexcused absences"?  Which ones will show up to your
athletic, musical, theatrical, or other events?  Which ones will
be more understanding of mental health issues?  Perhaps most
generally, which ones are open to special requests (or don't even
consider them special) and which ones will be offended by such
requests?

All of these can have a significant effect on a student's experience
in classes.  Few are documented well.

I realize for extensions and absences, many people have tried to
set up clear and unambiguous policies.  But broader institutional
signaling sometimes conflicts.  For example, I know of a faculty
member who has a policy something like "two missed quizzes permitted;
no excuses needed".  What happens if, say, you get Covid and can't
make it to the quiz?  It may be that they believe that illness is
just one of many reasons to miss a quiz.  It may be that they believe
that Covid is an appropriate exception and should not count.

I don't know that we can document all the hidden faculty behaviors
and expectations, as well as the differences between them.  I'm not
sure many of us would want all of them documented.  "Sam is a softie;
ask for an extension and you'll probably get one" means that people
sometimes deprioritize my class.  But it's also that I don't think
we can predict every situation let alone document every situation.

A host of values seem to be at play here.  One is _instructor
autonomy_.  Each of us is free to choose their own policies and
practices and to document them (or not document them) as they wish.
For some of the practices, such as extensions, I see a conflict
between a value (?) of "prepare students for the real world, where
people don't make exceptions" and the alternate of "perhaps everyone
should be making exceptions".  Alternately, there's a conflict
between _equality_ (e.g., "You can miss up to two quizzes; I don't
I don't care why you miss") and _equity_ (e.g., "I acknowledge that
some students may need multiple mental health days to get through 
the semester").

This past academic year, there was a problematic conflict between
institutional messaging that encouraged faculty to be more flexible
and institutional procedures (such as those from the Registrar's
office) that remained surprisingly rigid.

I'd also say that we had a piece of the Hidden Curriculum come up
in our early discussions, and that's what students are expected to
do when they hit a part of a reading, handout, or video that doesn't
make sense [5].  In some situations (e.g., when an instructor assigns
200 pages of reading between two class sessions), faculty might
assume that students will skip over the parts they don't understand
and perhaps make a note that they should ask in class.  In some
situations, faculty might expect students to do some exploration
or research to figure out more.  In some, faculty might ask students
to ask them.

One norm that seems to underlay this issue is that most faculty are
the kinds of people---who either naturally or by training---dig
into the terms or concepts they don't understand (e.g., "habitus",
"devolved regions of the UK", and "BAME" all appeared in one of our
readings).  We expect others to be similarly inquisitive.

The institution also values this approach; it's part of being a
life-long learner.  (Is that a value?  I think it is.)

Since I'm a broken record, or at least I play one on the Interweb,
I'll note that our policies on class workload provide a situation
in which we have what appears to be a clear policy (a four-credit
class should require approximately twelve hours of work each week,
including both in-class time and out-of-class time) that leaves many
of the details hidden (twelve hours _for who_ and _for what grade_?)
and that is not necessarily even followed by most faculty (e.g., I've
heard some faculty say that they expect the number of hours students
should spend for a class depends on the level).

We have also yet to have a substantive conversation on what a 48-hour
base work week---not counting other expectations (paid work; clubs,
arts, and sports; social development; etc.)---does to our students.

Unfortunately, the only value I see in this policy is that we do
things for show, rather than with substantive analysis.  Or perhaps
it's that we value following Federal guidelines, whether or not they
make any sense.

There's also a norm, although it took me awhile to unpack it.  We
assume that our normal students don't have work outside of classwork,
too, or that it should take second place to their schoolwork.  That's
a horrid assumption to make.

As I said, I'm a broken record.  I doubt I'll ever manage to move 
the needle on this issue [6].  But I'm going to keep trying [7].

**_Postscript_**: On the third day of the workshop, we broke into
groups of two to discuss some of the situations folks had raised.
We decided to focus on attendance.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, attendance
came up a lot, including questions from the new faculty side.  Are
we expected to keep attendance? [8]  If we get note about the absence
from SHAW [10], Academic Affairs, Disability Resources, or elsewhere,
do we have to count is as an excused absence?

Anyway, one of the things my partner and I came up with as a way
of addressing not only attendance, but other hidden syllabus issues,
would be to create a list of situations that faculty and students
have experienced relative to syllabi (e.g., that quiz + Covid
question above) and use them as a way to "stress test" syllabi [11].
For example, we could present each scenario to both a student and
the faculty member and see whether they come up with the same
answers.  It could be a valuable thing to try.  I'm not sure
faculty would put up with it, though.  And we did observe that
"instructor autonomy" is a core value at Grinnell.  But I find
myself thinking that even coming up with the list of situations
would be helpful for some faculty.

**_Postscript_**: I'm not teaching this coming year, but, as I move
on to preparing class for Fall 2023, I look forward to thinking
carefully about what needs to be better revealed in my teaching.

---

[1] Been taught?  Received guidance?

[2] Some of us give quizzes to help students better understand the
relevant information.

[3] That is, conduct a sensible Web search.

[4] For someone who is not supposed to be working this summer, I
nonetheless find that I have far too many conflicting appointments
and meetings.  I had three at 3pm on the second day of the workshop,
including the workshop itself.  My appointment with the dentist
won.

[5] I mentioned this situation above.  I wrote about it as a response
to the question(s), too. 

[6] Did I mix metaphors there?  Record players have needles.  You need
to move them when the record skips.  But I'm not sure those too
metaphors are used together.  And "move the needle" usually refers
to the needles that appear in instruments that measure things.

[7] If I succeed, I may have to change my classes significantly.
I guess that's okay.  I will petition to move to two-hour classes
for CSC-151, though.

[8] If a student fails and has stopped attending, we are expected to
provide information on when they last attended class.  That suggests
that we are expected to take attendance.  However, I don't think that
the _Faculty Handbook_ requires us to do so.  In the rare instance
that a student fails because they've stopped attending [9], I usually
approximate the date.

[9] Students rarely fail my classes.  It's rarer still that a student
fails because they stopped attending.  I tend to report missing
students with some regularity.

[10] Student Health and Wellness.

[11] It's not the phrase we used.
