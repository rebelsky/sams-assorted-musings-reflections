Reviews and notes about things I enjoy
======================================

*Eventually, I'll find that I'm out of serious topics and will instead
start writing about some of the things that are meaningful to me, or
at least provide joy.  (Other than my family.)  I'm starting a list.
I'm also including some reviews here, since I generally only review
things I enjoy.*
