These days, I notice that I'm finding it hard to complete everyday tasks? Whata kind of tasks? All sorts. I scheduled a surgery for early March more than a month ago; I only remembered to make the pre-anaesthesia appointment yesterday. I still haven't scheduled the pre-op visit with my family physician. (I did try, but I forgot that they close early on Fridays.) I needed to return a package; it's been sitting on my desk for three weeks. I haven't gone through the mail or balanced the checkbook. I still haven't given the Noyce custodial staff their annual holiday gifts. I even let things sit on the floor that I should pick up. I also haven't turned in my medical reimbursements for last year. I think I still have a week for those.

At first, I was going to attribute it all to grief. It's hard for me to get things done these days, particularly since I often feel like I'm only working at about 30% of my mental capacity.  If I'm struggling to do things, it's not surprsing that I'm not getting things done. And if I'm doing things more slowly, it's natural that I'm getting fewer things done. Fortunately, most bills are on autopay.

If I'm honest with myself, there's more to it than grief and it's effects. Or perhaps less. I've always sucked at completing everyday tasks. It's probably something I should discuss with a therapist. Sometimes it's just forgetfulness. For example, for the past three weeks, I've gone to bed each night saying "I should bring the phone number for my anaesthesia appointment to work so I can call during the day". However, it's not until I'm at work, setting up class, that I remember. I suppose I could be smart enough to ask Eldest to remind me. There are even times when he's still at home, so I could call or text him. Those ideas never occur to me at the right time.

Sometimes I don't get things done because of anxiety. I envision all the things that can go wrong when I do something. Maybe when I call for the appointment, they'll yell at me because I've taken so long to call. (No, I don't really believe that, but I still feel shame at taking so long.) They're senseless fears, but they're there.

Maybe grief just makes all of that worse. Anxiety now includes "they might say something about Michelle and I'll cry". And grief enhances forgetfulness [1].

However, it's also that I don't have Michelle here. She was great at saying "Have you done X yet?" She also knew me well enough that she'd often give up and just do the thing herself. Ah, the wonders of having someone who knows you too well [2].

Moving forward? Who knows. I'll just need to remember to be gentle with myself; it's okay to fail at everyday things. In most cases, the world won't end. Or perhaps it has already.

[1] Is "enchances forgetfulness" the right phrasing? Perhaps just "affects memory".

[2] The Sondheim quote is unintentional.
