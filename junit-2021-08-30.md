As a teacher of computer science and computer programming, I try
to inculcate a wide variety of habits in my students.  One of those
is testing, particularly some forms of unit testing.  That is, I
want my students to write tests (or experiments) that help build
confidence that their code achieves what it is supposed to achieve,
at least at the small level (e.g., individual procedures or small
sets of procedures).  I know that writing good tests is hard, so
I try to give my students practice.  That is, nearly whenever I have
students write code, I ask them to write tests or at least think about
the tests they would write [1].

This semester, I'm teaching our upper-level course in algorithms.
I'm also one of those folks who thinks that you best understand
algorithms and data structures whe you implement them.  The first
assignment asks them to implement data structures they should have
already encountered in data structures and algorithms, the third
course in the CS major [2].  As you might guess, I asked them to
write tests.

Unfortunately, not all of my colleagues feel the same way about
testing that I do.  And not all of my colleagues teach all the parts
of Java that real programers use [3].  So some of my students have
asked for guidance on how they write JUnit tests on the command
line.  This document contains my quick and dirty instructions for
using Java and JUnit on the command line, without any additional
frameworks or build systems, not even Maven or Ant.

I haven't attempted anything close to deep guidance on the many features
of JUnit or the common aspects of unit testing frameworks.  I haven't
attempted to describe the unit testing habits I expect, from careful
thought about edge cases to looking for ways to automate more
complicated and even randomized tests, such as [the test for binary
search that I adapted from Jon Bentley's book](cnix-binary-search-2).
Those are topics for another day.

Here goes.

---

Getting started
---------------

JUnit is a standard unit testing framework for Java.  You use JUnit
slightly differently on each development platform for Java.  The 
[JUnit User Guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)
provides instruction for most major platforms.  It's a little bit
vague on command-line Java, and that's what we will often use, so
I will focus primarily on those issues.

What should you know?

A test is just a `void` method that is annotated as a test using `@Test`.
A typical test method contains *assertions* about the expected behavior
or values of a procedure.  For example, in testing a `square` procedure,
I might assert that `square(4)` is `16`.  We tend to write different
test procedures when testing different aspects of our procedure or program.
(At least I tend to do that; different testers have different customs.)

What can you assert?  The class [`org.junit.jupiter.api`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.7.2/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html)
gives the standard assertion methods.  The most common ones are

* `assertEquals`, which checks that two expressions have the same value (or close to the same value, if you use the variant designed for real numbers);
* `assertTrue`, which checks that a Boolean expression returns true;
* `assertAll`, which checks whether a sequence of executable expressions
  all succeed (do not throw exceptions); and
* `assertThrows`, which checks whether an executable expression throws
  a given type.

Both `assertAll` and `assertThrows` require what Schemers often
call "thunks" and what JUnit calls "executables".  An executable
is an object that implements the `Executable` interface, providing
a method called `execute`.  Since that interface requires only one
method, we can create executable objects on the fly using lambda
expressions.  For example, if `a` is an `[ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html)`, then
an executable that adds a null at index 5 might read
`() -> a.set(5, null)`.

Suppose we want to test whether adding that null throws an exception (which
it should, if the ArrayList has fewer than four elements).  Here's what we
might write.

```
  @Test
  void testInvalidAddition() {
    ArrayList<String> a = new ArrayList<String>();
    assertThrows(IndexOutOfBoundsException,
                 () -> a.set(5, null));
  } // testInvalidAddition()
```

Grouping tests
--------------

Of course, tests can't live by themselves.  Like most methods in Java,
they need to appear in a class.  

```
class MyArrayListTests {
  @Test
  void testInvalidAddition() {
    ArrayList<String> a = new ArrayList<String>();
    assertThrows(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class,
                 () -> a.set(5, null));
  } // testInvalidAddition()
} // class MyArrayListTests
```

And, as is typical in Java classes, we need to import things.  When
working with JUnit, we typically import the assertion methods (which
are static) and the `@Test` annotation.

```
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertAll;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class myArrayListTests {
  // ...
} // class MyArrayListTests
```
Preparing to run tests
----------------------

We'll be running the standalone JUnit console.  You'll need to
download the appropriate `jar` file from
<https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-console-standalone>
and store it somewhere sensible.  I keep mine in `~/lib`, but you
can choose whatever you'd like.  I've been using version 1.7.2,
which is relatively recent.

Running tests
-------------

Once we've set up the tests in a class (in a `.java` file), we need to 
compile the `.java` file and then run it.  (Note that we should compile
all the `.java` files we're working with.)

```
$ ls
MyArrayListTests.java
$ javac MyArrayListTests
... lots of errors, such as package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist
```

Whoops.  We need to make sure that we have the `.jar` file on our CLASSPATH.

```
$ export CLASSPATH=/path/to/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.2.jar:$CLASSPATH
$ ls
MyArrayListTests.java
$ javac MyArrayListTests
$ ls
MyArrayListTests.class  MyArrayListTests.java
```

The `.class` file is the compiled version.

Now we're ready to run the tests.  There's probably a better approach than the one I use, but this seems to suffice.  The `-cp .` flag says to look for class files in the current directory and the `-c MyArrayListTests` gives the name of the class.

```
$ java -jar /path/to/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.2.jar -cp . -c MyArrayListTests

That's about it.  You should be able to figure out the rest.  Send me questions if you can't (and you're one of my students).

    ArrayList<String> a = new ArrayList<String>();
    assertThrows(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class,
                 () -> a.set(5, null));
  } // testInvalidAddition()
} // class MyArrayListTests
```

[1] Strangely enough, the course in which I was worst about enforcing
testing was probably CSC-324, Software Design.

[2] Officially, the course has a title something like "Object-Oriented
Design, Data Structures, and Algorithms".  Historically, that course
is called "CS2" in the CS education literature.  At Grinnell, we've
inserted an extra course in the introductory sequence that does some
linked data structures while getting students used to memory management
before we hit them hard with ADTs, data structures, and algorithms.

[3] Admittedly, I don't, either.
