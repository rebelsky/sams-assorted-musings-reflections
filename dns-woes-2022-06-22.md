The other day, my laptop started acting up.  By "my laptop", I mean
the College-owned loaner MacBook Pro I've been using while my regular
College-owned MacBook Pro is in the shop [1].  And by "acting up",
I mean that it seemed reluctant to connect to many Web sites.  I
couldn't go to <https://math.berkeley.edu> [2].  More importantly,
I couldn't reach <https://remote.cs.grinnell.edu> and I couldn't
ssh to ssh.cs.grinnell.edu.  I need access to the MathLAN [4] to do
much of my work.

It looked like a DNS issue [5]:  When I tried to ping sites that I could not
open in my Web browser, I got errors like the following.

    ping: cannot resolve remote.cs.grinnell.edu: Unknown host

I also tried `dig`-ing those sites and got no info.
 
I tried the normal slew of possible fixes for situations like this.

I turned off my Wi-Fi and turned it back on again.

I reset the DNS cache [6] on my machine with the pair of commands
appropriate for macOS Monterey.

    sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
    sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

I rebooted the machine.  I hate rebooting encrypted laptops; I've gotten
used to the quick reboot from an SSD and, now that the machine has to
decrypt, it feels like a decade ago when we needed to wait for the spinning
platters.  I also have to restart the damn DisplayLink manager each time
I reboot.  And I hate typing my 29-character password [7].

The fixes worked for a bit, or a few sites, but not universally.  After
I'd spent a bit of time on the computer, I'd find that it wouldn't reach
sites that I hadn't tried recently.

What do normal people do when they reach this point?  Or even earlier
points, such as when they find that their Web browser won't connect
to expected sites?

My next steps were to do a bit more diagnosis.  

Could I connect to the sites from my iPad, which is on the same network?
Yes.

Were the iPad and the MacBook using the same DNS server?  Yes.  It
was even the expected one: 192.168.0.1.

If I opened a page on the iPad and then used the fancy mechanism for
transfering to the MacBook [8], would I then see the page?  Nope.  It
appears that it transfers the URL, but not the underlying DNS info.

Did things work if I used the IP address (obtained from the iPad) rather 
than the domain name?  Usually.

My conclusion?  There was something wrong with how my MacBook was
processing internal DNS requests.  That's beyond my knowledge.  But
I looked a bit more under the Network Control Panel [9] to see what
I could figure out.  

I discovered that there were some additional network services running,
including two copies of Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter and one
Cortex XDR Network Filter.  There was also a third Cisco AnyConnect
Socket Filter that was not running.  Upon further investigation, I
found that the first Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter was a content
filter and the second was a DNS proxy.

And I was reminded that ITS [10] puts lots of fun software on our
machines [11].  Perhaps the problem was with some of that software.

So I called the ITS help desk.  The delightful help desk attendant,
who we will call "(TSD)" [12], because that's how they show up in Teams
Chat, did their best to help me.  They mentioned that others were 
having similar problems and hypothesized that it was a server-side
issue.  But others should be using a different DNS than I am.

Since it was beyond their knowledge base, (TSD) decided that the best
approach to put in a ticket and route it to Networking.  That's better
than what I can do; while I can put in tickets, I can't route them
immediately [14].  

A few minutes later, (TSD) messaged me on Microsoft Teams to ask for
the asset tag on my machine.  And a few minutes after that, DNS started
working fine on the MacBook.

So I thanked (TSD) on Teams.  And they said "I didn't do anything."
That's not quite true.  They put in a ticket.  But it doesn't look
like Networking had seen it yet.

And I was reminded of what I tell my students: **Computers are
sentient and malicious.**  More precisely,

> Computers are sentient and malicious.  They don't like us.  But
they show it in subtle ways.  An obvious one is that they tend to
crash at the worst possible time.  Another one is that they refuse
to do something until we ask for help from an authority figure, and
then work perfectly when they do exactly what we did.

> You'll find that happens regularly in this class.  You'll try
something that should work.  It won't work.  You'll try again.  It
still won't work.  You'll ask me or a class mentor for help.  We'll
do the same thing.  And it will work fine.

> So remember: Computers are sentient and malicious.  When things go
wrong, it's probably not your fault.

At some point, I usually follow up with some more accurate statements.
For example,

> If you find the user interface confusing, it's not your fault.  A
human designed it.  Unfortunately, too many interface designers design
for themselves, rather than for others.

or

> Modern computers have so many interlocking parts that it's nearly
impossible to check every situation.  Unchecked situations sometimes
lead to problems.  That's one of the reasons I ask you to think so
much about testing.  Good testing reduces the space of unchecked
situations.

I also tell my students that asking for help often requires you to
explain what's going on in some detail, and that when you explain things
in detail, you figure out what's wrong.  That wasn't the situation here.

In any case, this was one of those times when the simple act of asking
for help got the job done, even though I learned nothing by explaining
my problem and the people helping did nothing.  As I've said, computers
are sentient and malicious.

I just wish I had determined a way to resolve this problem the next
time it crops up.  Oh well; at least I have a working DNS.

**_Followup_**

I drafted this musing immediately after all of the DNS woes.  I thought
things were good.  Then I discovered that the DNS was still not fixed.
For example, I could not get an IP address for cs61a.org [15].

Here's what a typical dig failure looks like.

```
$ dig cs161a.org

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> cs161a.org
;; global options: +cmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```

Here's what the response should look like.

```
$ dig cs161a.org

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> cs161a.org
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 291

```

In the followup conversations with ITS, I also learned about one
possible issue.  [Cloudflare, a major DNS server, had some problems
the prior
evening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-june-21-2022/).
But that shouldn't explain why things worked okay on my iPad and
not my MacBook.

It seems like clearing the DNS cache and rebooting once again helped.
We'll see how long that lasts.

Have I mentioned that I hate computers?

[1] That's a musing for another day.

[2] You'll learn why in another musing [3].

[3] Perhaps even tomorrow.

[4] The Linux network for Grinnell's CS department.

[5] DNS, or Domain Name Service, is the service that converts a
domain name, such as remote.cs.grinnell.edu, to its IP address,
such as 132.161.157.185.  To do this resolution, your computer first
checks its internal knowledge and then asks a nearby DNS server.
That server, in turn, checks its stored knowledge, failing that,
asks another DNS server.

[6] The DNS Cache is where the computer stores what it learns about
the relationships between names and IP addresses.  Sometimes that
information gets mangled.  Or sometimes domains change their IP
addresses.  Clearing the cache sometimes helps with DNS issues.

[7] Hmmm ... Was I told to have a thirty-character password?  'Eh.
Twenty-nine is close enough.

[8] Command-Tab on the MacBook.

[9] Do we still call them Control Panels?  It's one of the System Preferences.

[10] Information Technology Services.

[11] Fortunately, I am still free from the strangely named "BeyondTrust".

[12] Parens and all.

[14] I was going to say that I can't increase their priority, but then
I looked back at our ticketing system and it appears that I can.  I just
try to leave most of my tickets at low priority.

[15] See endnote 2.
