One of the many things I love about Grinnell is our enthusiasm for
talking about teaching and learning.  We have workshops, discussion
groups, reading groups, informal conversations, and more.  And people
are willing to try new things.  I remember when I was a young faculty 
member at a meeting of Faculty for the 21st Century.  Most of the the
early-career faculty were worried about how their senior colleagues
would react if they tried something new or different in the classroom.
The Grinnell faculty appeared to feel that they would be encouraged and
supported [1].

We're all experiencing a different kind of teaching this fall,
teaching that is both remote and accelerated.  Some of us have
taught remotely before.  Some of us have learned remotely.  Some
of us have taught or learned in schools with the quarter system.
But I expect very few, if any, of us have taught in seven-week terms
or have taught full courses online in seven-week terms.  When you add
in the pandemic, we have a number approaching zero.

In any case, during winter break the Dean's office and the Center for
Teaching, Learning, and Assessment [2] are sponsoring four workshops
to help us think through what we learned from the fall and what we
might do to prepare for the spring.

For the first workshop, we've been asked to read an old [3] piece
by Maha Bali and Bard Meier entitled "[An Affinity for Asynchronous
Learning](https://hybridpedagogy.org/affinity-asynchronous-learning/)"
[4].  In it, Bali and Meier present many reasons to consider
asynchronous learning.  I'm trying an experiment of musing about
the article (or at least the topic) before the conversation, as a
way of preparing myself for the conversation, and then updating the
musing retorspectively, after the conversation.

Preparation

I have mixed feelings about asynchronous learning, especially for
Grinnell classes and for Grinnell classes intended for first-year
students [5].  It's not that I don't believe in asynchronous learning;
I do my of my own learning asynchronously. In addition, the first
remote class I taught was asynchronous and that course was successful.
But I also have a lot reasons I chose to teach my Grinnell courses
primarily as synchronous courses.

First, one of the key (ungraded) goals of the course is to give
students experience collaborating synchronously with others; to
"pair program", as we call it.  Asynchronous pair programming doesn't
have the same effect.  And pair programming does a lot of good
things: It gives students respect for different approaches, it helps
students learn about different kinds of strengths, it introduces
students to other people in a way they are most accustomed to meeting
new people.

Meeting new people is quite important; it's one of the ways friendships
and collaborations form.  I realize that many people now meet online.
But for most people in that age group, in-person meetings remain
core.  It's also why they choose a place like Grinnell.  And I hear
from my students that when they work in pairs, they not only talk
about the material, but also socialize.  That can also happen online,
but it's still a bit less natural.  I expect that the more we rely on
remote learning, the more people will get accustomed to building
friendships and chatting informally asynchronously, but for now,
synchronous conversations do it.  Good synchronous classes build
community.

Third [6], synchronous classes allow me to put students on the spot,
most often by calling on them randomly.  Doing so serves at least
two important purposes: First, it gives students practice trying to
questions for which they may not have an immediate answer.  As I tell
my students, life, particularly professional life, is filled with
situations in which you are expected to make a comment on something
for which you have incomplete knowledge.  Synchronous classes give
you practice doing so.  Second, it helps students realize that they
are not the only ones who are confused.  When three people in a row
say "I'm not sure", students feel better about being unsure.  It's
harder to see peer confusion in a world in which people can take their
time to prepare answers.

Synchronicity also appears to be an excellent form for what I think
of the Socratic Method, or the Paper-Chasing Method.  That is, we help
students develop ideas and strategies of thinking by asking them a
series of questions that guide them.  I must admit that this approach
may be biased toward certain types of people, but it's also a form
that seems to develop students well.

Can one do these things asynchronously?  I'm not sure about pair
programming; part of the core of pair programming is that the
conversation is live.  But one can build respect for other kinds of
skills and for other people asynchronously.

One can also build community asynchronously.  In my "Art of Code,
Code of Art" course, we built community through shared critiques
of each others' work.  Looking for things to compliment and ways
to improve work builds community, particularly if you are adding
comments daily.  It's different, but it's powerful.  And so, I suppose,
this also permits the creation of friendships.

Can students learn to answer unexpected questions asynchronously?
To me, asynchronous answering is a different skill, one based more
on gathering information and evidence.  On the other hand, as 
Bali and Meier (and many others) suggest, asynchronous chats can be
better for students who are too shy or too initimidated (or who
just need a bit more time).

Running asynchronous classes, or at least good asynchronous classes,
requires a very different skill set.  How do you keep students engaged?
How do you get people to connect?  How do you build community?  If you
don't do those things, then an asynchronous course can feel like little
more than self-study.  And that's one reason I might worry about it
at Grinnell; students and their families are not paying Grinnell
tuition for self-study.

Then there's the "cost" of supporting students.  In a synchronous
course, it's easy to ensure ....

Keeping students on task again.

Oh, look.  Here's [an article they cite](https://hybridpedagogy.org/the-discussion-forum-is-dead-long-live-the-discussion-forum/)

> We’ve argued elsewhere that building community is at the heart of learning, whether on-ground, online, or hybrid. 

..

> What almost all of these tools have in common is their openness on the web, in stark contrast to the password-protected forums inside an LMS. The best LMSs leverage these existing networks and are increasingly making the capacity for openness part of their design. When learning environments are opened (or left open) to a wider community of voices, the benefits resound throughout a student’s learning process.

Would today's risk-averse Grinnell ever allow such a thing?   Students
posting to the public may mean we can identify which class they are in.
And they might insult someone, which means the institution can be
sued.  Plus, few public posting tools are approved.  Danger Will

too.

wasn't one in the message we received about it.
