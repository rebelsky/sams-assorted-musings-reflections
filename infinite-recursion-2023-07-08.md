The other night, as Michelle and I were driving home from Chicago in a rainstorm, I started reciting a story I recall from childhood.  It began like this.

> It was a dark and stormy night.  We were standing on a ship.

I'll tell you more in a moment.  But first, I'd like to describe the context of the memory.  The story comes from a book that I recall as one of my favorites.  I remember sitting on the floor between my bedroom and the hall closet, reading it.  I believe the book was filled with puzzles and unexpected twists, but I can't be sure.  I don't recall the title.  All I recall is the one story.  It went something like this.

> It was a dark and stormy night.  We were standing on a ship.  The Captain said to me, "Tell me a story, my son."  And so I began.

> > It was a dark and stormy night.  We were standing on a ship.  The Captain said to me, "Tell me a story, my son."  And so I began.

Except it wasn't formatted like that.  The text looped around the page so that the second instance of "It was a dark and stormy night" came right after both the first and second instance of "And so I began."  Or maybe there was just one instance of each.  I remember the tale.  I remember that the text looped.  I remember that there was a Captain and a ship.  A narrator, too.  A night that was dark.  And stormy.

Did I get the words right?  I'm relatively confident about the "It was a dark and stormy night."  I can recall whether I was standing or we were standing.  I can't recall whether the next sentence was phrased as above, or as 

> "Tell me a story, my son," the Captain said to me.

That construction seems a bit complicated for a kid's book.  So I assume the one I've chosen is the correct one.

Did I begin?  Did I say?  I suppose I did neither.  In point of fact, it was the narrator who began.  Or said? 

While I can't recall the book---or even many of the details---it strikes me that the book had a massive impact on me.  After all, recursion is central to computer science, particularly to the kinds of computer science I do.

I wonder if I'll ever recall anything else about the book.  If so, and if someone has borrowed it from the local library, I suppose I can also recall the book.
