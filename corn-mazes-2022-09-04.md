Back when we first came to Iowa, twenty-five years or so ago,
Michelle and I discovered corn mazes.  "What are corn mazes?", you
might ask (at least if you're not from the Midwest).  They are what
they sound like: Someone cuts a maze into a field of corn.  Some corn
mazes are small, some are larger.

It might seem trivial to go through a corn maze.  But corn is tall.
And cornfields are dense.  Plus, people of my generation have encountered
way too many horror films that involve corn.  So it's a
bit more nerve wracking than you might expect (or than I expected).

I've always wondered what led to corn mazes.

The other day, I heard Dean Montgomery talk about [the three
sisters](three-sisters-2022-09-01): climbing beans, squash, and
corn (maize).

And I finally understood.

Or I think I did.

Corn mazes are either (a) a really bad pun or (b) someone misunderstanding
the phrase "corn (maize)" and deciding to implement that phrase.

In any case, maize mazes (or mazes of maize) can be amazing.
