Given an increasingly risk-averse institution and an increasingly
complex academic world, I'm considering Professional Liability
Insurance.  But the thought of having such insurance is relatively
new to me.  My quick Web search includes articles from the higher-ed
press that oppose the idea (your institution should be protecting
you) [1] and support the idea  of obtaining such insurance (but it
won't always) [2] .  I've been putting it off, but reading an article
about a lawsuit between faculty at Wellesley (Martin v. Lefkowitz)
[3] reminded me that institutions don't always protect you in
situations they should.

I don't see any Professional Liability Insurance available through
ACM [4].  There's a program through AAUP [5].  IEEE has a program,
but the focus seems to be licensed engineers or other professionals
[6].

From what I can tell, the AAUP program, which seems most appropriate
for me, is only active in years in which you are enrolled [7].  So
if you do something this year and are sued five years from now, it
will only hold if you still have coverage five years from now.
Since retirement is potentially in sight, I'm not sure how I feel
about needing to continue coverage after I retire.

I also wonder about the different situations for CS educators, such
as our liability for the software our students write or the software
tools we ask students to use.

I'm turning to the wonderful SIGCSE community for advice.  If you
have or have considered Professional Liability Insurance, I'd love
hearing about what insurer you chose and why and what limits you
chose.  If you considered Professional Liability Insurance, but
decided not to get it, I'd appreciating hearing about why.  If you
have thoughts on the particular kinds of liabilities we face as
computer scientists, I'd appreciate hearing those, too.

Feel free to email me directly, and I'll summarize to the list in
a week or so.  If you think an issue is worth discussing, feel free
to post directly to the list.

Thanks!

p.s. If you're wondering why I'm reading about Martin, it's because
Kristen Clarke, President-elect Joe Bidenâ€™s nominee for assistant
attorney general for civil rights, hosted him at Harvard when she
was a student and that has created some controversy.  I was reading
up on it.
