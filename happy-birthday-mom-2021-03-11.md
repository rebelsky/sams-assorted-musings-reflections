The other day, Michelle said something like, "Do you realize Thursday
would be your mother's 90th birthday if she had lived?"  Mom always
assumed she'd live to at least ninety, since her mother had.  But,
well, that didn't happen.  She's been gone for nearly twelve years.
I teared up a little [1].  And then I thought about what she might
she might have been doing for the past twelve years or so.

If she'd known she had more than a decade (and she assumed she did),
she would have eventually chosen a big project.  Mom always did
like long-term planning.  I remember when she retired from BU, or
maybe a bit before that, when she said something like "I have half
of my adult life left; it's time for a second career."  I'll admit
that I don't know what her decade-long project would be; there were
so many things that interested her.  And she'd been in Grinnell for
less than a year, too much of which was in the Mayflower assisted
living facility rather than her house.

So I guess I'll focus on some of the inevitable things.

She would have spent time at the boy's numerous events, watching
them compete in sports, work behind the scenes or act in plays,
and perform musically [2].

She would have thrown a lot of parties.  I appreciate that when she
was in the assisted living facility, she found ways to have McNally's
deliver wine and cheese so she could throw her own little parties.
Once she was back in her home [3], she would have continued doing
so.  Mom was nothing if not social.

She would have been politically active, particularly during the
Trump administration.  She might not have been able to march, but
she'd have been handing out water bottles to those who marched.
She'd be writing letters, donating money, building coalitions,
speaking out, and more.  I assume she'd also have been active during
the Obama administration; I know many progressives felt betrayed
by a variety of his decisions and actions.

She would have been writing poetry.  I know how excited she was about
the Mayflower poetry group.

She would have written a book.  What book?  I'm not sure, but I'm
guessing it would be something like "Life in retirement: Thrive,
don't just survive."

She would have written letters, letters to friends old and new [4],
letters to politicians, letters to the kids, even though they were
nearby.

She would have found a way to give talks.  She loved giving talks.
And people seem to learn from her talks.

She would have taken advantage of all the College has to offer: Classes
[5], musical and theatrical events [6], the museum, talks, and more.

She would have traveled, at least if she could.

She would have spent too much time at the casino with Kathy.  Maybe
would have had Kathy here for longer if she had.

She would have argued, discussed, considered, analyzed, and more.

And she would have done things I can't even imagine, or don't want
to imagine [7].

Happy ninetieth birthday mom!  I'm glad you were able to do so much
during your more-than-a-decade in Grinnell, at least in my imagination.

[1] For those of you who've lost a parent recently: It does get better.
But it always hurts a bit.  (Having finished the first draft of this,
I can say sometimes it sill hurts a lot.)

[2] One of the benefits of living in a small town is that folks don't
think it strange when you cross the traditional high-school cliques.

[3] I'll assume she could make it back to her home.

[4] I can still hear her singing "Make new friends, but keep the old,
one is silver and the other gold."

[5] She'd started attending David Campbell's class.

[6] I know she would have loved the Met series.  I think that means 
she would have found a way to sneak into Kelly Maynard's classes.  But
she also would have loved all the concerts in Sebring-Lewis, particularly
when Middle Son was performing.

[7] Sorry mom; sometimes you were a bit too open about your private life.
