Round three of registration for Fall 2023 finished a few days ago.  At some point soon, we should be moving on to round four [1,2].  What's there for me to do?  I should look at the end-of-round-three data, right?

It seems that the [course offerings report](https://odsstu.grinnell.edu/reports/report/RGS/Catalog%20and%20Courses/Course_Offering_0007) isn't quite accurate.  For example, it lists my CSC-151 as having -7 seats available and a capacity of 24.  The course does have a capacity of 24, but it was temporarily dropped to six, which is done to reserve 18 seats for incoming first-years.  I wonder if I've been misreading the course offering report this whole time.  I also wonder what's going on with the report.  And I wish that it also showed us how long the wait lists are.  Oh well, you can't have everything.

I note that SOC/GWS-395, _Gender-Based Violence_, remains significantly over-enrolled.  I wonder if the goal was always to have it capped at twenty or twenty-four.  I can't tell which it is, since GWS-395 is listed as ten over capacity and a capacity of 14, while SOC-395 is listed at ten over capacity and a capacity of ten.  Yeah, something is definitely going wrong with the reports.

Are there any newly over-enrolled courses?  Let's see ... PHI-131-02?  Not new.  CSC-151-01?  New, but not quite accurate.  (See above.)  CHM-221-02?  Not new.  ENG-227-01, _American Literary Traditions I_?  Newly over-enrolled (by three students).  PHE-100-47?  Now new.  PHY-132-01?  Not new.  However, it's less over-enrolled.  Strange.  CHM-221-03?  I don't think this was previously over-enrolled, but the other sections were.  It is now marked as "Balanced".  I thought we weren't balancing anymore.  Strange.  PHY-131-03?  Not new.  ART/FMS-225?  Still over-enrolled.  CHM-221-01?  Still over-enrolled, but now by one rather than three.  It's also marked as balanced.  CHM-221L-03?  I wasn't keeping track of labs.  I'm still not keeping track of labs.  EDU-295-01?  Previously over-enrolled.  PHE-100-18?  Still over-enrolled.

One new over-enrolled class!  All the rest seem similar enough.  On to the full courses.

Wait a second!  Excel seems to have eaten my spreadsheet of filled classes.  Damn.  Have I mentioned that I hate computers?  And I hate Microsoft?  Oh well, I'll estimate as I go.

Maybe I'll combine old and new data, doing my best to indicate which round courses filled in.

In American Studies ...

* AMS-130-01 (round 3), _Introduction to American Studies_.  There seem to be six slots preserved for incoming first-year students.  At least that's what I get if I use the [search courses utility](https://colss-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/Student/Student/Courses/Search) and then combine data.  There's also a waiting list.

In Anthropology ...

* ANT-260-01 (round 3), _Language, Culture, and Society_.  
* ANT-291-01 (round 2), _Methods of Empirical Investigation_.  

In Biological Chemistry ...

* BCM-262L-01 (round 2), _Introduction to Biological Chemistry Lab_. 

In Biology ...

* BIO-251-02 (round 2), _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms w/lab_.  Section 1 has two slots.  Section 4 has six slots.  Section 3 has 15 slots.  
* BIO-295-01 (round 3), _ST: People in Biology_.  I'm excited about this new course.  I'm glad that students seem to be, too.
* BIO-325-01 (round 1), _Fungal Biology_.  This filled in round 1, but now has a slot.  However, it's marked as closed, so I'm listing it here.
* BIO-366-01 (round 1), _Immunology_.  This filled in round 1, but now has two slots available.  However, it's marked as closed, so I'm listing it here.
* BIO-368-01 (round 2), _Ecology w/lab_.
* BIO-380-01 (round 2), _Molecular Biology w/lab_.
* BIO-395-01 (round 2), _ST: Medical Genetics_.

In Chinese ...

In Chemistry ...

* CHM-221-01 (round 2), _Organic Chemistry I w/lab_.
* CHM-221-02 (round 2), _Organic Chemistry I w/lab_. 
* CHM-221-03 (round 3), _Organic Chemistry I w/lab_.  As I mentioned earlier, these three sections were balanced.
* CHM-221L-01 (round 2), _Organic Chemistry I Lab_.
* CHM-221L-02 (round 2), _Organic Chemistry I Lab_.
* CHM-221L-03 (round 2), _Organic Chemistry I Lab_.

* CHM-363L-02 (round 2), _Physical Chemistry I Lab_.

In Classics ...

* CLS-255-01 (round 3), _History of Ancient Greece_.  It took three rounds for an MC class to fill?  Wow!  Cross-listed in History.

In Computer Science ...

* CSC-151-01 (round 3), _Functional Problem Solving w/lab_.  If we'd limited this to the six returning students that we normally cap it at, I think this would have filled in round 1.
* CSC-161-01 (round 2), _Imperative Problem Solving w/lab_.  
* CSC-161-02 (round 2), _Imperative Problem Solving w/lab_.  I think we have room for students, since we don't tend to hold spots for first-years.  So this may be a falsely full course.
* CSC-207-01 (round 2), _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, & Algorithms)_.
* CSC-207-02 (round 2), _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, & Algorithms)_.

In Digital Studies ...

* DST-154-01 (round 3), _Evolution of Technology_.
* DST-295-01 (round 3), _Digital Project Development and Practice_.  This course sounds exciting!  I'm glad to see it filled.

In East-Asian Studies ...

* EAS-195-01 (round 3), _ST: Introduction to East Asian Animation_.  Also cross-listed in Chinese.

In Economics ...

* ECN-240-01 (round 2), _Resource and Environmental Economics_.
* ECN-280-01 (round 2), _Microeconomic Analysis_.  
* ECN-280-02 (round 3), _Microeconomic Analysis_.  
* ECN-282-01 (round 3), _Macroeconomic Analysis_.  
* ECN-286-01 (round 3), _Econometrics_.  
* ECN-286-02 (round 2), _Econometrics_.  
* ECN-295-01 (round 3), _ST: Behavioral Economics_.  I've heard that Behavioral Economics is an exciting new area.  I'm surprised it took until round three to fill.  
* ECN-326-01 (round 3), _Financial/Managerial Accounting_.

_Did none of the Econ seminars fill?  Strange [3]._

In Education ...

* EDU-101-01 (round 3), _Educational Principles in a Pluralistic Society_.
* EDU-101-02 (round 3), _Educational Principles in a Pluralistic Society_.  I think we're holding six slots in each section for incoming first-years.

* EDU-295-01 (round 2), _Special Topic: Mapping Racial Trauma_.
* EDU-301-01 (round 3), _Teaching & Tutoring Writing_.  Ooh!  A course with Tisha Turk.  Fun!  Cross-listed with the Writing Lab.

In English ...

* ENG-120-04 (round 3), _Literary Analysis_.  It looks like the other three sections have many spots available.  It also looks like there are five or so spots in each section reserved for incoming first-years.
* ENG-205-01 (round 3), _The Craft of Fiction_.
* ENG-206-01 (round 3), _The Craft of Poetry_.  I know that Ralph is moving to SFS.  Is this the last time he's teaching this course?
* ENG-227-01 (round 3), _American Literary Traditions I_.
* ENG-295-01 (round 3), _ST: Anthropocene Fictions_.
* ENG-395-01 (round 2), _ST: History and Future of the Book_.  Maybe Erik will offer this again when I'm next on leave in Grinnell.  Or when I'm retired.

In Environmental Science ...

* ENV-120-01 (round 3), _Environmental Challenge and Responses_.
* ENV-125-01 (round 3), _Introduction to Earth System Science w/lab_.
* ENV-125L-02 (round 2), _Intro to Earth Systems Science Lab_. 
* ENV-145-01 (round 3), _Nations and the Global Environment_.  This always fills, doesn't it?  And it has a capacity of 40.  David Campbell is a compeling teacher.  Ah!  I see that they've left 10 slots for incoming first-years.  

In Film and Media Studies ...

* FMS-255-01 (round 2), _Fundamentals of Video Production_.  Also listed as ART-255-01, in Studio Art.

* PHE-235-01 (round 3), _Psychological Foundations of Sport_.

In Physics ...

* PHY-131-02 (round 2), _General Physics I w/lab_.  Now I understand how these filled so quickly and why they are over-enrolled.  As in the case of CSC-151, these have a lot of spots reserved for incoming first-years.
* PHY-131-03 (round 2), _General Physics I w/lab_.  
* PHY-132-01 (round 2), _General Physics II w/lab_.

It looks like there are zero returning students in section 1, four in section 2, and two in section three.  Did Polisci reserve all of their slots for incoming first-years?  If so, that's something advisors should have known in advance.
* POL-220-01 (round 3), _Foundations of Policy Analysis_.  Cross-listed with Policy Studies.

In Studio Art ...

* ART-111-01 (round 3), _Introduction to the Studio_.
* ART-111-02 (round 3), _Introduction to the Studio_.  There's still space in section 3.  I'm glad to see that there are also slots reserved for incoming first-years. 
* ART-134-01 (round 3), _Drawing_.  Didn't this fill in round 2?  I assumed it did.  And it's another course that has some reserved seats for incoming first-years.  It also has a waiting list of eight.  _We need more studio art courses/faculty!_ [4]
* ART-238-01 (round 3), _Painting_.
* ART-255-01 (round 2), _Fundamentals of Video Production_ (also listed as FMS-255-01).

Where do we stand for nearly-full classes?  I'm still tempted to say, "You can analyze [the data](https://odsstu.grinnell.edu/reports/report/RGS/Catalog%20and%20Courses/Course_Offering_0007) as well as I can", and leave it at that.  But it shouldn't take me much work to list the numbers, if not the names.

I hadnt realized that there are six sections of ANT-104, _Anthropological Inquiries_.  It looks like there are six slots in each section reserved for incoming first-years.  Most sections (other than section 6) have about nine open slots.

Are there things that puzzle me in all this?  I'm puzzled that ANT/BIO-220, _Racing Through Genetics_, is still open, with surprisingly many slots available.  It's rare that you can get a course taught by faculty across disciplines (Anthropology and Biology, in this case).  It's rarer still that you can take a course taught by such excellent faculty.

I'm frustrated that the report page doesn't clarify how many slots are actually available for returning students and how many are reserved for incoming first years.  **We need that information for advising.**  At least _I_ need that information for advising.  Maybe I'll put in a ticket to get a revised report.  I should ask about wait lists, too.  I did discover that the very tight cap on _Introduction to Political Science_ [5] is documented on the policy page; I need to read that more carefully next time.  We need our cap of six returning students per fall section of CSC-151 documented better.

I discovered that I'm easily confused, especially when I've been on leave.  I kept seeing Jennifer Shook listed in Theatre [6], and, for some reason, I confused her with the Jennifer Snook in Sociology.

I learned about some new special topics courses.  In the past, I scanned through the list of special topics courses to see what new things were happening at the College.  I didn't do so this year, probably because I'm on leave.  Possibly because I'm too busy with all the other aspects of registration.  But I saw enough interesting special topics that I should make a point to starting doing so again next year.

I see that some departments are in as bad shape as CS.  We have all our 200- and 300-level courses full, except for two slots in CSC-341 [7].  Psychology has all their 200- and 300-level courses full, except for five slots in PSY-260-01, _Cognitive Psychology w/lab_.  As far as I can tell, Sociology only has one upper-level course open, with 13 slots in SOC-270-01, _Gender and Society_.  If there are other departments in similar situations, I'm sure my readers will let me know.

Am I done with this season of musing on registration?  Perhaps.  We'll see if my muse calls me back to this subject.

**_Postscript_**: Now that I've discovered that I misunderstood some of the data , I've added disclaimers to my earlier musings.

[1] Round four officially opens at 7 a.m. on May 1.

[2] At present, a message says something like "Fall '23 Registration, Round 1, will open shortly.  Sorry for the delay."

[3] I've been writing "Strange" a lot, haven't it?  I suppose that makes sense; many things about Grinnell are strange.

[4] Sam is a broken record.

[5] Six slots total, across all sections.

[6] More precisely, Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies.

[7] You remember the long name, right?
