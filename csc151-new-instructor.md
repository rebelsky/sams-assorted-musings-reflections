This coming spring, one of my awesome new colleagues [1] is co-teaching CSC-151 with me. This will be the first time that they've taught CSC-151, and I may be less available than normal, so it seemed to be a good time to start gathering the information on CSC-151 both for the colleague and for future colleagues [2]. The information may also be useful for students (current and prospective), class mentors, faculty at other institutions, and, um, others I have not yet determined.

I expect that there's enough information that this guide will require multiple musings. I'm not yet sure what information will end up in this introductory guide and what will end up in separate documents. I started with a quick outline of topics and we'll see where I get from there. Since life is busy these days, I'm writing the document a bit at a time.

Primary goals.  Computational thinking.  Collaboration.  Community.  Functional thinking.  Welcoming.

Primary components.  Workshop-style class (flipped classroom).  Pair programming.  Mastery grading.  Scheme.

Why Scheme?

Two environments: DrRacket and Scamper.

Multiple perspectives.

Multiple versions: Image making, Sound/music making, Digital humanities/text analysis, older Data science.  Goal of letting students find a version that matches their interests.  Also helps keep it exciting for faculty.

Why don't we use SICP or HtDP?  Permits different local perspectives?

Web stuff.  Also shows perspectives.  One set separate the public materials (labs, readings, etc.) from the private ones (LAs).

Gradescope.

The dangers of teaching with Sam.

[1] I have many awesome new colleagues.  But we need more.  I also have awesome more-experienced colleagues.

[2] I suppose it may be useful for old colleagues, too.
